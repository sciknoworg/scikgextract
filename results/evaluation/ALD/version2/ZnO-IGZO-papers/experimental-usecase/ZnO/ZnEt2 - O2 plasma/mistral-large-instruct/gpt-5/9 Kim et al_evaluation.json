        "rationale": "Largely incorrect and schema-violating. Multiple required numeric fields are null (schema disallows): pressure.quantityValue.numericValue, nucleationPeriod.quantityValue.numericValue, dosingTime[*].precursor/coReactant.numericValue, purgeTime[*].precursor/coReactant.numericValue, flowRates[*].precursorFlow/coReactantFlow/purgingGasFlow.numericValue, uniformity.variation.numericValue, conformality.aspectRatio.numericValue, filmComposition.elementalConcentration.values.quantityValue.numericValue, roughness.value.quantityValue.numericValue, electricalProperties values. Key factual errors: (1) thicknessControl.filmThickness set to 60 nm with 600 cycles and GPC=0.1 \u00c5 for all compounds\u2014none are reported and contradict the article (devices use 5 nm IGO on 5 nm ZnO; XRD comparisons use 20 nm IGO; ZnO SCL is 5 nm; no 60 nm film). (2) supercycleDesign is wrong: sequence ['In2O3','Ga2O3','ZnO'] with 1:1:1 counts is not reported; ZnO is a separate SCL, and the IGO supercycle uses In:Ga subcycles of In-only, 6:1, 4:1, 2:1 (Fig. S6). (3) materialProperties.crystallinity set to polycrystalline, but the process tied to the reported device metrics (\u03bc_FE=95.5 cm2/Vs, V_TH=1.33 V) corresponds to highly ordered crystalline bixbyite (222) IGO on ZnO/\u03b8-Al2O3 (GI-WAXD/TEM/XRD). (4) filmComposition.atomicRatio incorrectly includes Zn; the channel film is In\u2013Ga\u2013O only; compositions such as In2O3, In1.8Ga0.2O3, In1.7Ga0.3O3, In1.4Ga0.6O3 are reported (XRF). (5) Roughness is reported (rms 0.34\u20130.37 nm) but left empty. (6) Carrier/purging gas set to Ar is not explicitly stated (only O2/[Ar+O2] mixture fraction reported); treat as unsubstantiated. Correct values to use: precursors (DATI, TMG; DEZ) and co-reactant (O2 plasma) and PEALD temperature (250 \u00b0C) and plasma power (100 W) are correct; device properties match. To fix: remove/replace nulls with reported numbers; set film thickness to the reported values (e.g., IGO 5 nm on ZnO 5 nm for devices or 20 nm for XRD studies); correct supercycle (In:Ga subcycle counts of 6:1, 4:1, 2:1; exclude ZnO from supercycle); set crystallinity to highly ordered bixbyite (222) for SCL-assisted films; restrict atomicRatio elements to In and Ga; populate roughness with 0.34\u20130.37 nm and note XRF as composition method."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and partly incorrect relative to both the article and the schema. Major issues: (1) Multiple processes are described in the paper but only one process is provided and it conflates conditions: ho In2\u2212xGaxO3 grown on ZnO/\u03b8\u2011Al2O3 and rp In2\u2212xGaxO3 grown directly on \u03b8\u2011Al2O3 should be separate processes. (2) Missing ALD step for the \u03b8\u2011Al2O3 seed layer (PEALD at 150 \u00b0C, O2 plasma 50 W, TMA) although it is central to the growth; Al2O3 is absent from aldSystem and reactantSelection. (3) Numerous schema-required numeric fields are null or placeholders: pressure.numericValue, dosingTime/purgeTime/flowRates numericValues, nucleationPeriod, optical/electrical properties, uniformity.variation, conformality.aspectRatio, roughness.value, filmDensity.value\u2014these violate the no-null requirement and are not traceable. (4) Several values are invented or inconsistent with the article: growth-per-cycle (0.1 \u00c5) and number of cycles (600) not reported; filmThickness set to 60 nm while the article reports 5 nm channels (devices) and 20 nm films (XRD), ZnO SCL 5 nm, Al2O3 30 nm. (5) supercycleDesign is incorrect: ZnO is not part of the In\u2013Ga supercycle; counts should reflect reported In/Ga subcycle ratios (In-only, 6/1, 4/1, 2/1). (6) reactantSelection carrierGas and purgingGas are set to Ar without citation; only the plasma gas mixture (O2/[Ar+O2]) and O2 fraction are provided. (7) materialProperties.crystallinity is set to \u201cpolycrystalline\u201d while the device metrics given (\u03bcFE 95.5 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, VTH 1.33 V, SS 166 mV/dec, ION/IOFF \u2248 1e8) correspond to the highly ordered (222) films; atomicRatio wrongly includes Zn (the film is In\u2013Ga\u2013O). To improve: add a second process for rp growth; add the Al2O3 SCL deposition with TMA/O2 plasma details; correct film thicknesses (Al2O3 30 nm, ZnO 5 nm, IGO 5 nm for devices, 20 nm for XRD runs); fix supercycle counts (In/Ga = 6/1, 4/1, 2/1); set crystallinity appropriately per process; populate roughness (~0.34\u20130.37 nm, AFM); remove uninformed carrier/purge gas or justify; and avoid nulls, replacing only with article-backed values. Overall, the extraction does not meet schema completeness or factual traceability."
