        "rationale": "Several key fields are incorrect, ungrounded, or internally inconsistent despite some correct entries (PEALD, precursors, 250 \u00b0C, 2500 W, ~175 nm). Major issues: (1) Units/numerics wrong: growth-per-cycle set to 0.06 \u00c5 (Ga2O3) and 0.1 \u00c5 (ZnO), but article gives ~0.06 nm/cycle and ~0.1 nm/cycle (i.e., 0.6 \u00c5 and 1.0 \u00c5). Dosing/purge times are in milliseconds per schema but values were not converted from seconds (0.2 s, 28 s, 4\u20136 s reported \u2192 should be 200 ms, 28000 ms, 4000/6000 ms; extraction uses 0.2 ms, 28 ms, 4\u20136 ms). (2) Ungrounded values: reactor.manufacturer set to \u201cFinland\u201d (should be Picosun), pressure 10 mTorr (not reported), carrierGas and purgingGas set to Ar (paper only states O2+Ar mixture for the oxygen plasma co\u2011reactant; purge/carrier identity not specified), nucleationPeriod 5 cycles (not reported), refractiveIndex and absorptionCoefficient (not reported), electricalProperties (resistivity, Hall mobility, carrier density) and filmDensity (not reported), conformality aspect ratio (not reported). (3) Misinterpretation: flowRates.purgingGasFlow 80 sccm uses the Ar flow that belongs to the O2/Ar plasma mixture, not purge. (4) Supercycle design and sample mixing: subcycle counts set to 1:1 (50% ZnO ratio) while other properties correspond to 40% sample (roughness 0.24 nm, amorphous), and band gap 4.07 eV corresponds to 50% sample\u2014this mixes different samples into one process. The article describes two device-relevant films (40% and 50%); separate processes should be extracted. (5) Film composition/ratios: atomicRatio 1.0:0.2:1.5 and elementalConcentration value lack grounding beyond a single Zn at.% (19.32%)\u2014no full atomic ratio reported. (6) DeviceProperties misuse: fields meant for TFTs (field-effect mobility, Vth, SS) are populated though the article reports photodetector performance; only the on/off ratio (1.1\u00d710^5) is from the PD but mapped to TFT onOffRatio, which is semantically incorrect. Corrections: fix unit conversions for times and GPC; change manufacturer to Picosun; remove or justify pressure, carrier/purging gas identities and flows; do not assign purge flow from plasma Ar; extract two separate processes (40% and 50%) with internally consistent band gap, roughness, crystallinity, and supercycle counts; remove unreported optical/electrical/density/conformality/TFT metrics; if uniformity is included, derive from \u00b11 nm over ~175 nm (~0.6%)."

        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Several core elements are inaccurate, mixed across samples, or fabricated, and multiple distinct processes described in the article were not extracted. Specific issues: (1) Missing processes: The article reports ZnGaO films grown at two relevant ZnO cycle ratios (40% and 50%) on two substrates (Al2O3 (0001) and p-type Si). The extraction provides only one process and one substrate (p-Si). At minimum, separate processes are needed for 40% and 50% (and likely per substrate), as film and device properties differ. (2) Mixed/incorrect values: Band gap 4.07 eV (50% sample) is combined with roughness 0.24 nm (40% sample), yielding an incoherent single process. SupercycleDesign 1:1 only matches 50% ratio; it does not represent 40%. (3) Units/numerics wrong: Growth-per-cycle is off by 10\u00d7 (should be 0.6 and 1.0 \u00c5 from 0.06 and 0.1 nm/cycle). Dosing/purge times are given in Millisecond units but numeric values are in seconds; should be 200 ms (precursor), 28000 ms (O2), 4000 ms and 6000 ms (purges). Number of cycles (1750) is not reported. (4) Unsupported/fabricated fields: Reactor manufacturer is given as \u201cFinland\u201d (should be Picosun). Pressure (10 mTorr), nucleation period (5 cycles), delivery method, refractive index, absorption coefficient, resistivity, carrier density, mobility, film density, conformality aspect ratio, and atomic ratio are not reported in the article. Film density unit (g/dm3) is inconsistent with g/cm3 typically used. (5) Ald method listing: aldMethod should list Ga2O3: PEALD and ZnO: PEALD rather than a single \u201cZnGaO\u201d. (6) Device properties: TFT-specific metrics (field-effect mobility, threshold voltage, subthreshold swing) are not applicable/absent; on/off ratio should be reported per device (PD1: 1.1\u00d710^5 at 0 V; PD2: 1.4\u00d710^4) in separate processes. (7) Omissions: Uniformity can be grounded as ~0.6% from \u00b11 nm over 175 nm; film composition should capture reported Zn at.% (19.32% at 40%; 20.63% at 50%) and OV fractions (12.07% and 16.28%). To be complete and traceable, add separate processes for 40% and 50% ZnO cycle ratios (and per substrate if represented), correct units and GPC, fix reactor manufacturer, remove or justify unsupported parameters, and align supercycle design and properties with each specific sample."
