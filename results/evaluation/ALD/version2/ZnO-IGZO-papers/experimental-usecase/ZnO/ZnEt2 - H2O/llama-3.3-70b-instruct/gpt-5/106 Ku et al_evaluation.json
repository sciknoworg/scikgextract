        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues throughout. Key problems: (1) Schema violations: plasmaPower is null (must be omitted or a valid power object); pressure unit uses Torr but schema allows only MilliM_HG; growthPerCycle unit uses NanoM but schema requires ANGSTROM; dosingTime and purgeTime units use SEC but schema requires MilliSEC; nucleationPeriod is given as Time (SEC) but schema requires Count (UNITLESS); opticalProperties.absorptionCoefficient unit PER-CentiM not allowed (schema expects UNITLESS for the given quantity kinds); filmDensity unit GM-PER-CentiM3 not allowed (schema requires GM-PER-DeciM3). (2) Unsupported or invented values: flowRates (100/100/500 sccm), saturation=True, growthPerCycle=0.25 nm, refractiveIndex=2.0, absorptionCoefficient=10000 cm^-1, bandGap=3.4 eV with UV-Vis, all electrical properties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility, Hall), uniformity and conformality figures, XPS-derived composition and 1:1 ratio, AFM roughness and XRR density, deviceProperties (TFT metrics), filmStability and reproducibility\u2014none are reported in the article. (3) Incorrect factual mapping: crystallinity set to polycrystalline whereas the article reports epitaxial growth on (0001) sapphire; pressure value appears to reflect purge pressure (2 torr) but is placed as deposition pressure; nucleationPeriod value (3 s) confuses the 3 s stock period with nucleation (and wrong units). (4) Weak/uncertain traceability: carrierGas/purgingGas set to N2 is only suggested in general text (\u201csuch as nitrogen\u201d) not explicitly as used; filmThickness fixed at 50 nm though article states ~50\u201380 nm; deliveryMethod='Not Found' and reactor fields 'Not Found' are placeholders discouraged by the task requirements. (5) Process coverage: the article describes two modes (stock and non-stock) across a temperature range; only one process instance is provided. Properties to correct/review: remove null/placeholder fields; fix all unit enums to those allowed; limit values to those explicitly reported (e.g., precursor DEZn 10 ms, H2O 15 ms in MilliSEC; purge 10 s as 10000 ms; number of cycles=200; substrate and temperature); set crystallinity to epitaxial/XRD; avoid unreported optical/electrical/device/composition/uniformity/conformality data; represent purge pressure separately if schema allows or omit; consider separate processes for stock vs non-stock conditions."

        "rationale": "Major gaps and schema violations. The article reports two distinct ALD modes (stock/FRI and non\u2011stock/continuous flow) and multiple temperatures (25\u2013160 \u00b0C), but only a single process instance is extracted, omitting the non\u2011stock mode and the temperature series. Many values are fabricated or not traceable: flow rates (100/500 sccm), growth-per-cycle (0.25 nm), refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, electrical properties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility), device/TFT metrics, uniformity, conformality, composition (XPS), roughness, and density\u2014all not reported. Several schema/unit errors: pressure unit uses Torr instead of allowed MilliM_HG and reflects purge pressure (2 Torr) rather than deposition pressure; dosing and purge times are given in seconds but schema requires MilliSEC; nucleationPeriod is provided in Time with a 3 s value (this is the stock period) but schema requires Count (cycles); growth-per-cycle unit should be ANGSTROM, not NanoM; plasmaPower is set to null (type mismatch). Factual inconsistencies: crystallinity set to polycrystalline (article demonstrates epitaxial growth), film thickness fixed at 50 nm while article states 50\u201380 nm, carrier/purging gas assumed N2 without explicit evidence in Experimental, deliveryMethod left as Not Found instead of indicating flow\u2011rate interruption (stock mode). To improve: (1) extract separate processes for stock and non\u2011stock modes and, if described, for representative temperatures; (2) correct units to schema (MilliSEC for pulses/purges, ANGSTROM for GPC, MilliM_HG for pressure, Count for nucleationPeriod or omit if unknown); (3) populate only traceable parameters (pulse 10 ms DEZn, 15 ms H2O; stock period 3 s; purge 10 s; pump 6 s; cycles 200; thickness 50\u201380 nm; substrate sapphire (0001); TALD; precursors DEZn/H2O; purge pressure 2 Torr with allowed unit mapping); (4) set deliveryMethod to flow\u2011rate interruption for stock mode and continuous flow for non\u2011stock; (5) remove unsupported optical/electrical/device/uniformity/conformality/composition/roughness/density values or mark as not reported; (6) update crystallinity to epitaxial per XRD."
