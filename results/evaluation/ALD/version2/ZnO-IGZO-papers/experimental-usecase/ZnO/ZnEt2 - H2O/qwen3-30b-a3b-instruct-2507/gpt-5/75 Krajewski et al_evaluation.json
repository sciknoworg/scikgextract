Key problems: (1) Schema violations/units: plasmaPower is set to null but must be an object\u2014omit it if not used; purgeTime units are MilliSEC but numeric values (8 and 20) reflect seconds\u2014should be 8000 ms and 20000 ms; carrierDensity reported as 4.5e17 per m3 but Table 2 gives 4.5\u00d710^17 cm^-3, which converts to 4.5\u00d710^23 m^-3; resistivity is given as 0.58 \u03a9\u00b7m but from Table 2 (conductivity 0.58 \u03a9^-1 cm^-1) the resistivity \u2248 1/0.58 \u03a9\u00b7cm \u2248 1.724 \u03a9\u00b7cm = 0.01724 \u03a9\u00b7m; numberofCycles (600) is inconsistent with GPC 1.8 \u00c5/cycle and film thickness 188 nm (would require ~1044 cycles). (2) Untraceable/fabricated values: reactor pressure (1 mTorr), growth saturation (True), nucleationPeriod (10 cycles), flow rates (precursor/co-reactant/purge), optical properties (refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap via Tauc), uniformity (5%), conformality (AR 10), film composition via XPS (50% and 1:1 ratio), film density (5.6 in g/dm^3 per the unit), and all TFT device metrics are not reported in the article. (3) Minor: while dosing times (DEZn 60 ms, H2O 15 ms) and purge times (8 s after DEZn, 20 s after H2O) match series 3 qualitatively, the purge times are numerically incorrect due to ms vs s. (4) Although several correct items exist (material ZnO, TALD, DEZn/H2O, N2 purge, Savannah 100 reactor, glass substrate, 100 \u00b0C, film thickness 188 nm, mobility 8 cm^2/Vs, polycrystalline), the numerous incorrect/missing and fabricated entries outweigh them. Properties to correct/review: plasmaPower (remove), purgeTime values (convert to ms), carrierDensity (convert to m^-3), resistivity (recalculate and use correct unit), numberofCycles/GPC/filmThickness consistency, remove or justify pressure, flowRates, saturation, nucleationPeriod, optical/uniformity/conformality/filmComposition/filmDensity/TFT metrics and otherAspects unless supported by the article."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Largely incomplete and non-traceable. Only one process is extracted despite the article reporting multiple distinct ALD cases: (i) DEZn/H2O on Savannah 100 over six series and multiple temperatures (Table 1, Table 2), and (ii) DMZn/H2O on F-120 with different pulse times and growth down to 30 \u00b0C. Many values are fabricated or untraceable: reactor pressure, all flow rates, nucleation period, saturation flag, number of cycles, uniformity, conformality, refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap via Tauc, elemental composition and atomic ratio (XPS), film density (XRR), and all TFT device metrics. Several inconsistencies/errors: purge times from Table 1 are in seconds (8 s, 20 s) but encoded as 8 and 20 ms; carrier density converted incorrectly (should be 4.5e23 m^-3, not 4.5e17 m^-3); resistivity miscalculated from reported conductivity (\u22480.017 \u03a9\u00b7m, not 0.58 \u03a9\u00b7m); GPC\u00d7cycles contradict film thickness (1.8 \u00c5/cycle \u00d7 600 \u2248 108 nm vs 188 nm reported); plasmaPower is set to null (schema violation). Some values are partially traceable (DEZn/H2O, nitrogen purge, glass substrate, dosing/purge times, temperature 100 \u00b0C, thickness 188 nm, mobility 8 cm^2/Vs, polycrystalline/XRD, roughness range), but the extraction mixes them with non-supported data and omits other processes. To improve: (1) Extract separate processes for DEZn series (at least the Table 2 temperatures) and the DMZn/F-120 case; (2) Remove or correct unreported parameters (pressure, flows, nucleation, device metrics, composition, density, optical constants); (3) Fix unit conversions and consistency (purge times in ms with correct magnitude, carrier density in m^-3, resistivity from \u03c3, GPC/cycle count vs thickness); (4) Omit plasmaPower if not used; (5) Only include properties traceable to the article."
