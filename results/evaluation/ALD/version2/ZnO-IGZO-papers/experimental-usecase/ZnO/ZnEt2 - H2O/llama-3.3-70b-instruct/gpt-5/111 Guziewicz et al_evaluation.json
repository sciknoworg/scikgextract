Schema violations and placeholders: many required numeric fields are null or placeholders (pressure.numericValue=None; thicknessControl.growthPerCycle.values[0].value.quantityValue.numericValue=None; dosingTime/purgeTime/flowRates numericValue=None; nucleationPeriod numericValue=None; uniformity/conformality/roughness/filmDensity numericValue=None). ReactantSelection.carrierGas and purgingGas are set to 'Not Found' (non-traceable placeholders); supercycleDesign is not applicable for binary ZnO ALD yet is included with 'Not Found' and None; plasmaPower is present as None though TALD does not use plasma\u2014should be omitted. Factual mismatches: electricalProperties.mobility=160 cm2/Vs does not match the Si 100 \u00b0C polycrystalline film (text reports 8\u201350 cm2/Vs for polycrystalline films; 160+ cm2/Vs refers to monocrystalline ZnO on GaN at 250\u2013300 \u00b0C). electricalProperties.carrierDensity set to 4e18 with unit C-PER-M3 is both the wrong sample (monocrystalline GaN value) and has unit/scale error (article reports in cm^-3; if reported in m^-3 it should be ~4e24 and use PER-M3, not C-PER-M3). saturation=False is unsupported and contradicts statements about ALD self-limiting growth and operation in the ALD window (100\u2013200 \u00b0C). Device-level data are missing despite being reported: onOffRatio is None though the paper states I_ON/I_OFF=1e7 at 1.5 V for a ZnO-based TFT. FilmComposition.atomicRatio '1:1' is assumed and not traceable to the article. While some entries are correct (DEZn/H2O, Savannah-100 reactor, TALD, Si substrate, 100 \u00b0C, 3000 cycles, ~500 nm thickness, polycrystalline by XRD), the extraction contains numerous non-traceable values, incorrect units/scaling, wrong sample mapping, and many nulls, thus failing both the article alignment and schema constraints. Properties to correct/review: electricalProperties.mobility and carrierDensity (value, unit conversion, and sample context), saturation, deviceProperties.onOffRatio, removal of supercycleDesign, removal of plasmaPower or provide valid object, and replacement of all None/'Not Found' placeholders with grounded values or omit optional fields where allowed."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Bad completeness. The article describes multiple ZnO ALD processes (Si, glass, GaN/Al2O3 substrates; 100\u2013300 \u00b0C; monocrystalline at \u2265250 \u00b0C on GaN; polycrystalline on Si/glass; an additional optimized low\u2011T process with n \u2248 5\u00d710^16 cm^-3), but only a single process is extracted. The single process is not semantically coherent: it sets substrate=Si and T=100 \u00b0C (polycrystalline) yet uses electrical values characteristic of monocrystalline GaN at \u2265250 \u00b0C (mobility 160 cm^2/Vs; carrier concentration ~4\u00d710^18 cm^-3). Carrier density units are incorrect and unconverted: schema expects m^-3 (PER-M3) but 4\u00d710^18 cm^-3 was entered as 4e18 with unit C-PER-M3; correct would be ~4e24 PER-M3 if that value applied. Many required/important fields are missing or populated with null/placeholder values not traceable to the text: processParameters.pressure, growthPerCycle, nucleationPeriod, dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, uniformity.variation, conformality.aspectRatio, roughness.value, filmDensity.value, optical properties, resistivity. ReactantSelection.carrierGas and purgingGas are set to \"Not Found\" despite the article specifying purging with an inert gas (type unspecified). SupercycleDesign is included with placeholders even though this is a binary process and no supercycle is used. FilmComposition.atomicRatio is set to 1:1 without any measurement reported. DeviceProperties are largely empty; the article reports an I_ON/I_OFF \u2248 10^7 (at 1.5 V) and forward current density \u2248 10^4 A/cm^2 in related devices, which were not captured. To improve completeness: (1) extract separate processes for GaN (250\u2013300 \u00b0C, monocrystalline, Table 1), for glass (100\u2013300 \u00b0C, Table 2), and the optimized 100 \u00b0C low\u2011n film; (2) correct electrical property units/values and align them with the specific substrate/temperature; (3) remove unsupported placeholders (e.g., supercycle) and avoid nulls by omitting optional fields or clearly noting \"inert gas (unspecified)\" where appropriate; (4) populate available parameters (3000 cycles; 500 nm thickness at 100\u2013200 \u00b0C; 350\u2013400 nm at >200 \u00b0C; Hall effect as characterization; crystallinity per substrate/temperature) and device I_ON/I_OFF if included."
