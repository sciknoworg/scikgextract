Schema violations: multiple fields are null where objects/numbers are required (plasmaPower=null; supercycleDesign=null; deviceProperties fields=null; materialProperties.opticalProperties.*=null; electricalProperties.*=null; uniformity.variation.numericValue=null; conformality.aspectRatio.numericValue=null; filmComposition.elementalConcentration.values.quantityValue.numericValue=null; roughness.value.numericValue=null; filmDensity.value.numericValue=null; otherAspects.filmStability/reproducibility=null; flowRates.*.quantityValue.numericValue=null). Using nulls violates the schema types. Numerical/unit errors: pressure set to 7.0 mmHg, but article reports 7.0\u00d710^-2 Pa (\u22485.25\u00d710^-4 mmHg); dosingTime uses 0.4 with unit MilliSEC (should be 400 ms for 0.4 s); growth-per-cycle set to 0.25 \u00c5 without support\u2014article provides 600 cycles \u2192 ~100 nm at 300 \u00b0C, implying ~1.7 \u00c5/cycle; filmThickness set to 150 nm together with 600 cycles is inconsistent with the article (600 cycles correspond to ~100 nm). Unsupported assertions: saturation=true and nucleationPeriod=1 cycle are not reported; atomicRatio 1:1 not reported; many \"Not Found\" placeholders where values should be omitted instead. Process coherence and coverage: Only one process is extracted although the article clearly reports multiple conditions (with/without +10 V bias at 600 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, 130 \u00b0C, and a case with bias only during first two cycles). The single process also mixes parameters from different cases (e.g., T=600 \u00b0C with 600 cycles, which were stated for 300 \u00b0C). Crystallinity is set to polycrystalline, contradicting the 600 \u00b0C +10 V case that shows epitaxial (002) orientation; the electric-field condition itself is not captured. Corrections needed: remove or fill all nulls with schema-compliant values; convert pressure to correct unit/value; convert dosing times to ms; compute GPC from reported cycles/thickness and keep filmThickness consistent with the chosen temperature/condition; split into separate processes for the distinct experiments (bias on/off and different temperatures) and set crystallinity accordingly; omit optional sections when data are not reported instead of inserting nulls or invented values."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Extraction is largely incomplete and not schema-compliant. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes described in the article are not represented. Distinct experiments at 600 C (with and without +10 V), 300 C (with and without +10 V; and +10 V only for first two cycles), and 130 C (with and without +10 V) should be separate processes. The current output merges details (e.g., 600 C, thickness ~150 nm with 600 cycles that were only stated for 300 C, thickness ~100 nm), yielding an incoherent process. (2) Numerous schema violations: many required numeric fields are set to null (uniformity.variation, conformality.aspectRatio, filmComposition.elementalConcentration.values, flowRates.*.quantityValue.numericValue, roughness.value, filmDensity.value), booleans set to null (otherAspects.filmStability, reproducibility), and optional objects incorrectly set to null (plasmaPower, supercycleDesign). Device properties fields are present with nulls instead of being omitted. (3) Incorrect or unsupported values: pressure is misreported as 7.0 mmHg instead of 7.0e-2 Pa (~5.25e-4 mmHg); dosing time recorded as 0.4 ms instead of 0.4 s (should be 400 ms to match schema units); growth-per-cycle 0.25 \u00c5 is not reported and conflicts with the only inferable value (~1.7 \u00c5/cycle from 600 cycles \u2192 100 nm at 300 C); number of cycles (600) is not given for the 600 C, 150 nm case; crystallinity set to polycrystalline contradicts the epitaxial (002) orientation reported with +10 V at 600 C; saturation=True and nucleationPeriod=1 cycle are not supported by the text; atomic ratio 1:1 is not reported. (4) Missing key, traceable parameters that could be captured: correct pressure (converted to schema units), correct exposure and purge times (0.4 s; 10\u201320 s), number of cycles and thickness for the 300 C case (600 cycles, ~100 nm), and appropriate crystallinity descriptors for each condition. To improve: split into multiple processes per condition; correct unit conversions (especially pressure and time); remove optional fields rather than inserting nulls; only include values traceable to the article; populate required fields with valid numbers and QUDT units where the article provides them."
