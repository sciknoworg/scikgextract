Key errors: (1) Method mismatch: aldSystem.aldMethod set to PEALD while deliveryMethod and the paper describe pulsed PECVD with simultaneous O2 and DMZ and no purge; ALD-specific constructs (supercycleDesign, purgeTime) are inapplicable and not supported by the text. (2) Dosing/pulse times: article uses 2 s plasma exposures; extraction lists 2.0 MilliSEC (2 ms) for both precursor and co-reactant and even separates them despite simultaneous delivery\u2014wrong by 10^3 and not traceable. (3) Purge steps: paper states purge steps are eliminated; extraction includes purgeTime=100 ms and purgingGas=Ar\u2014unsupported. (4) Flow rates: precursorFlow=15 SCM-PER-MIN is actually the Ar carrier gas at 15 sccm; unit given (SCM-PER-MIN) does not match sccm and value is not converted; coReactantFlow also unconverted. (5) Thickness control inconsistency: growthPerCycle=1.35 \u00c5/pulse (25 \u00b0C) with numberofCycles=100 implies ~13.5 nm, yet filmThickness=100 nm\u2014internally inconsistent and the numberofCycles is not reported in the article. (6) Plasma power, substrate, pressure are correct; temperature=25 \u00b0C is one condition used. (7) Saturation and nucleationPeriod values are not reported; setting saturation=False and nucleationPeriod=10 cycles is speculative. (8) Electrical resistivity: paper reports 45 \u03a9\u00b7cm at RT decreasing to ~2 \u03a9\u00b7cm; extraction gives 45 OHM-M (\u03a9\u00b7m), i.e., off by 100\u00d7 in units. (9) Many properties are fabricated/not traceable: bandGap=3.3 eV, absorptionCoefficient, refractiveIndex=1.85 (no specific values provided), uniformity variation 5%, conformality aspectRatio 10, filmDensity 5.6 GM-PER-DeciM3 (nonsensical and not reported), carrierDensity 1e17 m^-3, deviceProperties (mobility, Vth, SS, on/off, deviceStructure) \u2013 none are in the article. (10) Film composition: atomicRatio Zn:O=1:1 (XPS) is supported; however, elementalConcentration=50% is not explicitly reported and ignores stated C <1 at.% after sputter. Corrections needed: label the process as pulsed PECVD (or extract PE-ALD from a different source), remove ALD-specific steps (supercycle/purge) or set purge times to zero with justification, fix pulse time units to 2000 ms if schema forces ms, correct flow-rate units/conversions and map 15 sccm to carrier gas not precursor flow, reconcile GPC\u2013cycles\u2013thickness, correct resistivity units (e.g., 0.45 \u03a9\u00b7m for 45 \u03a9\u00b7cm), and remove unverifiable properties (band gap, device metrics, uniformity, conformality, film density, nucleation) not supported by the text."

        "rationale": "Major factual and schema-alignment issues. The article describes pulsed PECVD (simultaneous O2 and DMZ, no purge, plasma pulsed ~1 Hz) rather than ALD; however, the extraction labels the method as PEALD and populates ALD-specific fields (dosing and purge times), which are not applicable and not reported. Many values are fabricated or inconsistent: dosingTime (2 ms) and purgeTime (100 ms) are not in the paper and contradict the stated elimination of purge steps; supercycleDesign is not applicable; numberofCycles (100) with GPC 1.35 \u00c5/pulse does not yield the stated ~100 nm thickness; flowRates assign 15 sccm as precursor flow (this is Ar carrier, not DMZ flow); saturation flag and nucleationPeriod are not reported. Material properties include non-traceable values (refractive index 1.85 without wavelength context, absorption coefficient, band gap 3.3 eV with Tauc/UV-Vis method not used in the study, film density 5.6 g/dm\u00b3 not measured). Electrical resistivity is reported in the article as 45 \u03a9\u00b7cm at RT; the extraction records 45 \u03a9\u00b7m (100\u00d7 too high). DeviceProperties (mobility, Vth, SS, on/off, device structure) are entirely absent from the article but are filled with invented values. Uniformity and conformality metrics are also not reported in this study. Only some parameters are correct (substrate: Si; O2 80 sccm; Ar carrier 15 sccm; pressure 400 mTorr; plasma power 100 W; amorphous at RT; GPC 1.35 \u00c5/pulse at 25 \u00b0C), but the overall process representation is not coherent with the reported procedure and lacks traceability. Multiple temperatures/films reported in the article are not represented as distinct processes. Review and correct: aldMethod (should not be PEALD for this process), remove/adjust ALD-specific timing/purge fields, correct resistivity units/value, fix number of cycles vs thickness, remove non-reported device/optical/density/uniformity/conformality entries, and, if required by schema, mark unknowns rather than fabricating values; add separate processes for different substrate temperatures if representing distinct experiments."
