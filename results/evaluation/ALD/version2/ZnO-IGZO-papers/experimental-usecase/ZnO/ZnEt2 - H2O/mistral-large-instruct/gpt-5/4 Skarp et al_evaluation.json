        "rationale": "Major schema violations and multiple factual/unit errors. Key issues: (1) Growth-per-cycle is misconverted: article reports 0.16 nm/cycle (250 \u00b0C); extraction uses 0.16 \u00c5/cycle instead of 1.6 \u00c5/cycle. (2) Dosing/purging times are given in seconds in the article (0.55 s, 1.0 s) but encoded with unit MilliSEC without converting (should be 550 ms, 1000 ms). (3) Uniformity is encoded as 0.02 PERCENT (0.02%) whereas the article indicates <2% (should be 2 with unit PERCENT). (4) Required numeric fields are null, violating the schema: processParameters.pressure.numericValue, nucleationPeriod.numericValue, and many materialProperties fields (conformality.aspectRatio, filmComposition.elementalConcentration.values.quantityValue.numericValue, roughness.value, filmDensity.value). (5) Several object-typed fields are set to None, violating types: processParameters.plasmaPower, supercycleDesign, and deviceProperties.*. (6) Saturation is set to True without support in the article. While some items are correct (TALD, DEZ/H2O, N2 100 sccm through sources, 1200 sccm purge, 250 \u00b0C, 2200 cycles, 360 nm thickness), the above errors and schema violations render the extraction largely incorrect. Corrections needed: fix GPC to 1.6 \u00c5, convert dosing/purge times to ms, set uniformity to 2 PERCENT, remove or populate null object fields per schema, and supply only article-supported values (omit unsupported claims like saturation)."

Several required properties are null or missing numeric values (pressure.numericValue, nucleationPeriod.numericValue, conformality.aspectRatio.numericValue, filmComposition.elementalConcentration.values.quantityValue.numericValue, roughness.value.quantityValue.numericValue, filmDensity.value.quantityValue.numericValue). Many optional properties are included but set to null, violating the schema\u2019s object types (plasmaPower, supercycleDesign, opticalProperties.refractiveIndex/absorptionCoefficient/bandGap, electricalProperties.*, deviceProperties.*, otherAspects.filmStability/reproducibility). Multiple factual/unit errors: growthPerCycle recorded as 0.16 \u00c5/cycle instead of 0.16 nm/cycle (should be 1.6 \u00c5/cycle); dosing and purge times use milliSEC units but values from the article are in seconds\u2014should be converted to 550 ms (DEZ, H2O) and 1000 ms purges instead of 0.55 and 1.0; uniformity variation set to 0.02% but article reports <2% over large substrates. \u2018Saturation\u2019 is set to True without explicit support in the text. Safety note from the article (\u201csurplus DEZ destroyed by feeding air into the pumping line\u201d) is not captured. While key items (precursor/co-reactant, carrier/purge gas, cycles=2200, thickness=360 nm, temperature=250 \u00b0C, N2 flows 100/1200 sccm) are largely correct, the extraction is incomplete and not schema-compliant. To improve: correct units/values (GPC, dosing/purge times, uniformity), add/verify pressure, provide or omit (rather than null) optional fields, and fill required materialProperties (conformality aspect ratio, composition, roughness, density) or acknowledge they are unavailable per schema; include the reported safety detail."
