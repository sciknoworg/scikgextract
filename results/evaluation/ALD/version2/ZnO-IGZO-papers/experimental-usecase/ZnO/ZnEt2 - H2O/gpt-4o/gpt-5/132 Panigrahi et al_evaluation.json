        "rationale": "Extraction has numerous factual, unit, and schema issues and uses many placeholders/zeros not supported by the article. Key problems: (1) Schema violations/nulls: plasmaPower, opticalProperties.absorptionCoefficient, processParameters.supercycleDesign, and thicknessControl.growthPerCycle.filmThickness are set to None although these fields are typed objects; avoid including them or supply valid objects. (2) Unit/date errors: dosingTime and purgeTime are given as 0.1, 4.0, 6.0 with unit MilliSEC, but the article reports 0.1 s, 4 s, 6 s; they should be 100 ms, 4000 ms, 6000 ms. Pressure is reported as 10 mbar in the article but encoded as 10 mmHg; it should be ~7.5 mmHg. Resistivity is set to 100 \u03a9\u00b7m, whereas the article reports 100\u20131000 \u03a9\u00b7cm for low-T films; units and value are wrong. Carrier density is set to 1e19 m^-3; the article reports values in cm^-3 (e.g., >1e19 cm^-3 at 200\u2013300 \u00b0C and <1e18 cm^-3 below 150 \u00b0C); unit and magnitude are incorrect. (3) Unsupported/placeholder values: flowRates (all 0.0 sccm), filmThickness (0.0 nm despite 2 \u00c5/cycle \u00d7 500 \u2248 100 nm), uniformity (0%), conformality aspect ratio (0), elementalConcentration (0%), roughness (0 nm), filmDensity (0), deviceProperties (all zeros), otherAspects.filmStability/reproducibility (True) and safety (\u201cNot Found\u201d) are not reported in the article and should not be invented or left as zeros. (4) Process coherence/inconsistency: Only one process (150 \u00b0C) is extracted, while distinct depositions at 100, 150, and 300 \u00b0C are described; separate processes should be provided. Electrical properties likely correspond to different temperatures/substrates (glass at 300 \u00b0C) but are attached to a 150 \u00b0C process on p-type Si, causing inconsistency. (5) Minor: saturation=True and nucleationPeriod=0 cycles are not supported by explicit statements; \"deliveryMethod\" and several fields use \"Not Found\" placeholders. Corrective actions: remove null/object-type fields or provide valid objects; fix units for time (ms) and pressure (mmHg\u22487.5); compute film thickness (~100 nm) or omit if not reported; do not fabricate flow rates/uniformity/roughness/density/device metrics; align electrical properties with the correct temperature/substrate or omit; extract separate processes for 100, 150, and 300 \u00b0C; replace placeholders with grounded values or omit optional fields."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and contains several schema violations and non-traceable placeholders. Major issues: (1) Missing processes: The article reports distinct ALD depositions at 100\u00b0C, 150\u00b0C, and 300\u00b0C (and films also deposited on glass for electrical tests). Only one process (150\u00b0C on p-type Si) is extracted. Separate processes should be added for Tdep = 100\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C and for depositions on glass used for Hall/ECV. (2) Schema violations/nulls: Multiple fields are set to None or placeholder strings where the schema requires typed objects or factual values (e.g., plasmaPower=None, absorptionCoefficient=None, supercycleDesign=None, growthPerCycle.filmThickness=None). Required processParameters.thicknessControl.filmThickness is provided but set to 0.0 nm, which is not traceable. Many required materialProperties fields (uniformity, conformality, roughness, filmDensity) are filled with 0 or \u201cNot Found,\u201d which is non-factual and violates traceability. DeviceProperties are populated with zeros despite no TFT devices being reported; if required to include, this object should be empty rather than fabricated values. (3) Unit/value errors: Dosing and purge times are given as 0.1, 4, and 6 with unit MilliSEC; the article reports 0.1 s, 4 s, 6 s. Values must be converted to milliseconds (100, 4000, 6000) or use seconds if allowed. Reactor pressure is 10 mbar in the article; the extraction sets 10 with unit MilliM_HG, which is incorrect (10 mbar \u2248 7.5 mmHg \u2248 7500 MilliM_HG). Carrier density is set to 1e19 m^-3, which conflicts with the article (>1e19 cm^-3 for high-T films; 150\u00b0C not explicitly quantified). Resistivity 100 \u03a9\u00b7m is not reported and mismatches the article\u2019s 100\u20131000 \u03a9\u00b7cm for lower-T films. Film thickness is set to 0 nm; from GPC ~2 \u00c5/cycle and 500 cycles, the expected thickness is ~100 nm (and thickness was measured by ellipsometry). (4) Partial/incorrect traceability: Substrate is only Si, while glass substrates were also used for electrical measurements. Flow rates are required by the schema but set to 0 sccm, which is not reported. While some entries are correct (DEZ/H2O chemistry, N2 carrier/purge, reactor model, Tdep=150\u00b0C, GPC\u22482 \u00c5/cycle, band gap ~3.27 eV, refractive index ~2, XPS atomic ratio Zn0.45:O0.55 at 150\u00b0C), the overall extraction is far from complete and schema-compliant. Properties to add/review: add separate processes for 100\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C (and for glass substrate depositions); correct dosing/purge units; correctly convert pressure; provide non-zero, traceable film thickness; remove None/placeholder values; avoid fabricated device metrics; correct electrical properties per temperature or omit when not specified; fill flow rates only if reported or omit if schema allows."
