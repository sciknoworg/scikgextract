        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues. Examples: (1) Schema violation: processParameters.plasmaPower is set to null but the field type is object (and PEALD was not used), so it should be omitted. (2) Internal inconsistencies: temperature = 300 \u00b0C while filmThickness = 500 nm; the article states ~500 nm thickness only for 100\u2013200 \u00b0C, whereas \u2265250 \u00b0C yields 350\u2013400 nm. (3) Thickness control mismatch: 3000 cycles with growthPerCycle = 0.1 \u00c5 would give ~30 nm, not 500 nm; article implies ~1.7 \u00c5/cycle. (4) Many values are not traceable to the article and appear speculative: pressure (1 mTorr), dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, saturation, nucleationPeriod, uniformity, conformality, refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, roughness, film density, film composition by XPS, device structure, field-effect mobility, subthreshold swing, safety, film stability, reproducibility. (5) Electrical units/values incorrect: resistivity set to 0.018 \u03a9\u00b7m, but the article reports ~1.8\u00d710^-2 \u03a9\u00b7cm (which equals 1.8\u00d710^-4 \u03a9\u00b7m); carrierDensity given as 3.2\u00d710^18 with unit C\u00b7m^-3 is inconsistent (should use PER-M3 and convert 3.2\u00d710^18 cm^-3 to 3.2\u00d710^24 m^-3, or provide charge density accordingly). (6) Substrate/crystallinity/temperature incoherence: phase \u2018polycrystalline\u2019 conflicts with 300 \u00b0C on GaN/Al2O3 which yields monocrystalline per the article; mobility value 108 cm^2/Vs corresponds to 100 \u00b0C/GaN data, not 300 \u00b0C. (7) Device properties misinterpreted: article mentions I_ON/I_OFF \u2248 10^7 at 1.5 V; thresholdVoltage is not provided\u2014setting V_TH = 1.5 V is incorrect; field-effect mobility and SS not reported. (8) Single generic process used despite multiple distinct processes (different substrates and temperatures) described in the article. To correct: remove null plasmaPower, align temperature/filmThickness/GPC with the article, fix resistivity and carrier density units/values, restrict deviceProperties to the reported on/off ratio, and omit any unreported parameters or split into multiple coherent processes with fully traceable values."

        "rationale": "Largely non-traceable and internally inconsistent extraction with multiple schema and factual issues. Key problems: (1) Multiple processes are described in the article (different substrates: Si, glass, GaN/Al2O3; multiple temperatures 100\u2013300 \u00b0C; differing crystallinity and properties), but only one process instance is provided, collapsing disparate conditions into a single record. (2) Many parameters are fabricated or not reported in the paper: pressure (set to 1 mTorr), dosing/purge times (100 ms), flow rates (10/50 sccm), saturation (True), nucleation period (10 cycles), growth per cycle (0.1 \u00c5), uniformity (5%), conformality aspect ratio (10), refractive index (2.0), absorption coefficient, band gap and Tauc method, XPS elemental concentrations and 1:1 ratio, AFM roughness (2.5 nm), XRR density (5.6 g/dm\u00b3), device field-effect mobility, threshold voltage, and subthreshold swing\u2014all not provided by the article. (3) Internal inconsistencies: temperature set to 300 \u00b0C while film thickness is 500 nm; the paper states 500 nm for 100\u2013200 \u00b0C and 350\u2013400 nm for \u2265250 \u00b0C. Growth-per-cycle 0.1 \u00c5 contradicts 3000 cycles yielding 500 nm (would predict ~30 nm). Substrate is a single string combining multiple substrates, compromising process coherence. (4) Unit and value errors: resistivity entered as 0.018 \u03a9\u00b7m (1.8 \u03a9\u00b7cm) whereas the table shows 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b2 \u03a9\u00b7cm; carrier density set to 3.2\u00d710\u00b9\u2078 with unit C\u00b7m\u207b\u00b3 (should be number density and, if converted from 3.2\u00d710\u00b9\u2078 cm\u207b\u00b3, equals 3.2\u00d710\u00b2\u2074 m\u207b\u00b3). (5) Device properties: only I_ON/I_OFF \u2248 10\u2077 at 1.5 V is stated; threshold voltage, mobility, and subthreshold swing are not reported; the 1.5 V value was misused as V_TH. (6) Schema misuse: plasmaPower is set to null (invalid type per schema if present). To improve completeness, extract multiple coherent process instances (per substrate and temperature), ensure film thickness, cycles and GPC are consistent; correct units/conversions (resistivity in \u03a9\u00b7m or \u03a9\u00b7cm coherently; carrier density with PER-M3 or proper conversion); remove or mark as not available parameters not reported (pressure, flows, times, optical/XPS/AFM/XRR metrics) and only include values traceable to the text or tables."
