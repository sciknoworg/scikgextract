        "rationale": "The extraction mixes multiple experiments and contains many schema issues and unsupported/fabricated values. Key problems: (1) Process incoherence/traceability: substrate and temperature correspond to the membrane run at 85 \u00b0C, but dosing times (0.25 s/0.5 s), number of cycles (2500), GPC (1.76 \u00c5/cycle), and film thickness (440 nm) are from the flat Si wafer experiment at 220 \u00b0C. The membrane runs used 0.5 s/20 s or 1.5 s/45 s pulses and yielded ~28\u201356 nm at 85\u2013250 \u00b0C. (2) Unit errors violating factual alignment: dosingTime and purgeTime use unit MilliSEC but numeric values for seconds (e.g., 0.25 s) are entered as 0.25 MilliSEC (off by 1000\u00d7). (3) Schema violation: plasmaPower is set to null; if present it must be an object or be omitted since TALD was used. (4) Unsupported/fabricated parameters: flowRates (10 SCM-PER-MIN, 50 SCM-PER-MIN), nucleationPeriod (10 cycles), uniformity variation (5%), absorptionCoefficient (0.01), bandGap (3.3 eV), roughness (10 nm by AFM), filmDensity (5.6 g/dm3), elementalConcentration (50% by XRD) and atomicRatio 1:1 by \u201cXRD and ellipsometry,\u201d deviceProperties (mobility, threshold, SS, on/off, deviceStructure) are not reported in the article and/or use inappropriate methods (e.g., XRD cannot yield composition). (5) Electrical resistivity value incorrect: article reports ~0.03 \u03a9\u00b7cm; the extraction records 0.03 \u03a9\u00b7m (100\u00d7 too large); also the article labels it as \u201cconductivity\u201d but the unit indicates resistivity\u2014this should be converted correctly to 3.0e-4 \u03a9\u00b7m if used. (6) Missing or incorrect dosing for membrane experiment: the longer pulses (0.5 s DEZn/20 s purge/0.5 s H2O/20 s purge and later 1.5 s/45 s) at 85 \u00b0C or 250 \u00b0C are not captured; instead, planar-cycle values are used. (7) FilmThickness duplicated and inconsistent: 440 nm is for the flat wafer, not the 85 \u00b0C membrane process specified; membrane thicknesses (~28\u201356 nm) are absent. While some entries are correct (Beneq TFS-500, DEZn/H2O, N2 carrier/purge, ~4 Torr, cross-flow, TALD, aspect ratio ~300), the numerous inaccuracies, unsupported values, and schema/type errors lead to a very poor overall correctness. Properties to correct/review: substrate/temperature vs dosing/cycles/filmThickness coherence; dosing/purge units and values; remove fabricated flowRates, deviceProperties, optical/electrical/roughness/density/composition unless supported; correct resistivity units; remove null plasmaPower; represent separate processes for flat Si (220 \u00b0C) and membranes (85\u2013250 \u00b0C) with appropriate parameters."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect and incomplete relative to the article and the schema. Major issues: (1) Multiple distinct ZnO ALD processes reported are not separated into coherent process instances. The article describes: (a) flat Si at 220 \u00b0C, 0.25 s/0.5 s pulses, 2500 cycles \u2192 440 nm; (b) membranes at 85 \u00b0C and 250 \u00b0C with 0.5 s/20 s pulses reaching ~6 \u00b5m depth; (c) membranes at 85 \u00b0C with 1.5 s/45 s pulses yielding ~28 nm at surface and ~26 nm at 30 \u00b5m (conformal across 60 \u00b5m); (d) Si pores (AR ~10:1) at 250 \u00b0C with 0.5 s/20 s pulses. Only one process is provided and it mixes parameters across these, breaking semantic coherence (e.g., substrate = membrane at 85 \u00b0C, but GPC, cycles, and 440 nm thickness from flat Si at 220 \u00b0C). (2) Many fields are fabricated or not traceable: flowRates (sccm values not reported), nucleationPeriod (10 cycles not reported), bandGap and absorptionCoefficient (not reported), elementalConcentration and atomicRatio (not reported; XRD cannot provide these), roughness (AFM not reported), filmDensity (not reported), deviceProperties (no TFTs reported), otherAspects filmStability/reproducibility (not reported). (3) Unit/quantity errors: dosingTime/purgeTime use unit MilliSEC but numeric values are in seconds (e.g., 0.25 s should be 250 ms; missing 20 s and 45 s purges and 0.5 s/1.5 s doses for membranes); resistivity is given as 0.03 \u03a9\u00b7m but article reports 0.03 \u03a9\u00b7cm (should be 0.0003 \u03a9\u00b7m if converted). (4) Schema issues: plasmaPower is set to null (type mismatch; omit if not PEALD). (5) Missing key reported parameters for membrane runs (temperatures of 85 \u00b0C and 250 \u00b0C with corresponding pulse sets and thicknesses of 20 nm, 56 nm, ~28/26 nm) and for Si nanopores (250 \u00b0C, 0.5 s/20 s pulses). To be complete, add separate, coherent processes for each reported experiment; correct units and values; remove or leave unspecified any properties not supported by the article; and ensure all required schema fields are populated only with traceable data."
