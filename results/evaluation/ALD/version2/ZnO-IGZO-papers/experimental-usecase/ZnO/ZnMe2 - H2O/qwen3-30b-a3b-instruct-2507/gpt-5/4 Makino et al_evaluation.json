    "correctness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Largely incorrect and weakly traceable to the article, with multiple schema and unit issues. Key problems: (1) Fabricated/unsupported values: optical properties (n, bandgap, absorption), uniformity, conformality, roughness, film density, deviceProperties (\u03bcFE, VTH, SS, on/off), flowRates, nucleationPeriod, and filmComposition (50% and Zn:O=1:1 via SIMS) are not reported in the paper; SIMS in the article only discusses C and H impurities versus temperature, not Zn:O stoichiometry. (2) Unit/numeric errors: dosingTime and purgeTime are specified as 5 and 15 MilliSEC (ms) but the article reports 5 s and 15 s; they should be 5000 ms and 15000 ms. Growth-per-cycle is given as 0.14 \u00c5 (DMeZn) and 0.13 \u00c5 (DEtZn), but the article reports 0.14 nm and 0.13 nm, i.e., 1.4 \u00c5 and 1.3 \u00c5. Pressure is taken from base pressure 5\u00d710^-6 Pa but entered as 5e-06 MilliM_HG without conversion; correct conversion is \u22483.75\u00d710^-8 mmHg (\u22483.75\u00d710^-5 MilliM_HG). Flow-rate units (SCM-PER-MIN) and values are not provided in the article. Film density 5.6 with unit GM-PER-DeciM3 (g/dm^3) implies 5.6 kg/m^3, which is nonphysical for ZnO and not reported. (3) Schema violation: plasmaPower is set to null; if not used (thermal ALD), this property should be omitted rather than null. (4) While some elements are correct (precursors DMeZn/DEtZn, co-reactant H2O, N2 carrier/purge gas, delivery by bubbling, substrate glass, ALD method TALD, cycles of 200 and 300, and film thicknesses of ~28 nm and ~39 nm consistent with the reported GPC), the numerous unsupported/fabricated values, unit mistakes, and the null field make the extraction largely incorrect. Review/correct: dosing/purge times (units), GPC values (\u00c5), pressure conversion and definition (base vs process), remove unsupported optical/electrical/device/uniformity/conformality/roughness/density/flow/composition entries or justify with source, and remove null plasmaPower."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Major incompleteness and factual/unit inconsistencies. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes in the article (temperature sweep 90\u2013270 \u00b0C for both DMeZn and DEtZn) are reduced to only two processes (one per precursor) at a single temperature each; the reported study varies Tsub and properties across the range and should be represented as multiple processes or at least include the investigated temperature ranges. (2) Units and values are incorrect: growth-per-cycle is given as 0.14 and 0.13 ANGSTROM, but the article reports ~0.14 and ~0.13 nm/cycle; values should be 1.4 \u00c5 and 1.3 \u00c5 to be QUDT-compliant and consistent with the provided film thickness. Dosing/purge times are 5 s and 15 s in the article but encoded as 5 and 15 MilliSEC; they should be 5000 ms and 15000 ms. Pressure is taken as 5\u00d710^-6 Pa from the base pressure and entered as 5e-06 MilliM_HG (mmHg), which is numerically incorrect and not clearly the deposition pressure; proper conversion (~3.75e-08 Torr/mmHg) or omission if deposition pressure is not reported is required. (3) Unsupported/ invented data per schema fields: flow rates (sccm), nucleationPeriod (10 cycles), uniformity (5%), conformality (AR=10), optical properties (n, absorption, band gap and Tauc), roughness (AFM 2.5 nm), film density (5.6 g/cm3), elemental concentration (50%) and Zn:O=1:1 by SIMS (article used SIMS only for C and H impurities), electrical properties (absolute resistivity, carrier density, mobility values not reported; only trends and one mobility example given), deviceProperties (TFT metrics) \u2013 none of these are provided in the article and are not traceable. (4) Schema/quality violations: plasmaPower is set to null (should be omitted for TALD); reactor.manufacturer uses a placeholder \u201cNot Found\u201d; supercycleDesign provided with empty arrays though not applicable; purgingGas set to nitrogen despite purging described as evacuation. (5) Missing or undercaptured details that are reported: SIMS impurity trends (C and H vs Tsub) and crystallographic orientation evolution with Tsub are not represented; the ALD window ranges (120\u2013170 \u00b0C for DMeZn, 130\u2013170 \u00b0C for DEtZn, with behavior above 170 \u00b0C) are not fully captured. To improve completeness, add separate processes (or a temperature-parameterized set) covering the studied Tsub points, correct all units (ms, \u00c5, mmHg conversion), remove unreported properties, and include only traceable values (e.g., cycles, GPC, dosing/purge times, substrate, carrier gas, ALD window, qualitative crystallinity, SIMS impurity trends, and Hall measurement method with reported example values where given)."
