        "rationale": "Significant factual and schema issues. Schema violations: (a) processParameters.plasmaPower is null but must be an object or omitted; (b) pressure unit uses ATM, while schema restricts to MilliM_HG; (c) growthPerCycle value uses NanoM; schema requires ANGSTROM; (d) dosingTime/purgeTime units are SEC, schema requires MilliSEC; (e) materialProperties.filmDensity unit GM-PER-CentiM3, schema requires GM-PER-DeciM3; (f) opticalProperties.absorptionCoefficient unit PER-CentiM, schema allows only UNITLESS for the specified quantity kinds. Factual/traceability errors: (1) aldSystem.aldMethod set to TALD, but the article describes atmospheric-pressure ALE with spatially separated flows and substrate shuttling consistent with SALD; (2) temperature set to 450 \u00b0C while the provided filmThickness (51.7 nm) and XRD example correspond specifically to 200 cycles at 475 \u00b0C; (3) flowRates set to 200 sccm for precursor, co-reactant, and purge, but the article gives only a total gas flow of 200 sccm and no per-species values; (4) nucleationPeriod (1 cycle) not reported; (5) supercycleDesign not applicable to binary process; (6) opticalProperties: refractive index and absorption coefficient not reported; bandGap value 3.36 eV is from PL band-edge emission at 20 K, not UV-Vis; method should be PL at 20 K if included at all; (7) electricalProperties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility) and deviceProperties (TFT metrics) are not present in the article; (8) materialProperties.crystallinity set to polycrystalline, whereas XRD shows epitaxial c-axis oriented ZnO on sapphire; (9) uniformity, conformality, and filmDensity are not reported; (10) filmComposition: atomic ratio 1:1 and 50% elemental concentration are not provided; the only compositional statement is Cl < 1 at% by XPS. Corrections needed: set method to SALD; align temperature with the 200-cycle 475 \u00b0C case or adjust thickness accordingly; fix units per schema (pressure in MilliM_HG, GPC in \u00c5, times in ms, density unit as required) and remove null fields; remove or mark as unavailable all properties not reported (refractive index, absorption coefficient, electrical/device metrics, uniformity, conformality, density, nucleationPeriod, per-species flow rates, atomic ratios), and correct crystallinity to epitaxial c-axis oriented with XRD. Due to extensive inaccuracies and schema violations, the extraction is very poor."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and contains many values that are not traceable to the article and/or violate the schema. Key issues: (1) Fabricated or incorrect material/device properties: refractive index, absorption coefficient, electrical resistivity/carrier density/mobility, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, film density, TFT device metrics, and elemental concentration/atomic ratio are not reported in the article; crystallinity is incorrectly set to polycrystalline instead of epitaxial c-axis oriented (XRD). The optical characterization method is mislabelled (UV-Vis vs. PL at 20 K). (2) Process parameter inconsistencies: temperature is set to 450 \u00b0C while film thickness 51.7 nm corresponds to 200 cycles at 475 \u00b0C; flow rates are assigned as 200 sccm to precursor, co-reactant, and purge individually despite the article stating only a total flow of 200 sccm; nucleation period of 1 cycle is not reported. (3) Schema violations and unit errors: plasmaPower set to null (should be omitted or valid object); pressure unit given as ATM instead of required MilliM_HG; dosing/purge time units use SEC instead of required MilliSEC; growth-per-cycle uses NanoM instead of required ANGSTROM; absorptionCoefficient unit not per schema (expects UNITLESS enum in schema); filmDensity unit uses GM-PER-CentiM3 vs schema\u2019s GM-PER-DeciM3; thicknessControl places numberofCycles and filmThickness inside growthPerCycle and omits required values at the thicknessControl level. (4) Missing/uncaptured reported conditions: ZnCl2 and O2 partial pressures and exposure period ranges reported in Table 1/Figures are not accurately represented; number of cycles range (50\u20131200) not captured (only a single 200-cycle case, and misplaced in schema). To improve, remove unreported/fabricated properties, correct crystallinity and optical method, align temperature with the 51.7 nm/200-cycle example (475 \u00b0C) or adjust thickness accordingly, fix units to match schema (e.g., 2.6 \u00c5 GPC; 760 mmHg pressure; times in ms), correct thicknessControl structure including numberofCycles at the proper level, and avoid assigning individual stream flow rates when only total flow is provided."
