(2) Non-traceable or fabricated values: flowRates set to 200 sccm for precursor, co-reactant, and purge misinterpret \u201ctotal gas flow rate 200 sccm\u201d and are not reported individually; nucleationPeriod (1 cycle) not reported; optical refractiveIndex and absorptionCoefficient not reported; electrical properties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility) not reported; uniformity and conformality not reported; filmComposition values (50% and 1:1 by XPS) not reported\u2014only Cl <1 at% is stated; roughness 0.9 nm is not explicitly reported (paper states \u201c< 1.0 nm\u201d); filmDensity is not reported and unit used (g/dm3) is inconsistent with typical reporting; deviceProperties (mobility, Vth, SS, on/off, deviceStructure) are entirely absent from the paper; safety, filmStability, and reproducibility statements are not provided. (3) Correct items include: method as thermal ALD (TALD) is plausible for AP-ALE (no plasma), ZnCl2/O2/N2 selections, sapphire (0001) substrate, delivery method via actuator, temperature 475 \u00b0C, film thickness 51.7 nm for 200 cycles, saturation true, PL band-edge emission ~3.36 eV, epitaxial crystallinity via DC-XRD. Given the numerous incorrect, speculative, or non-traceable entries and unit errors, overall correctness is very bad. Properties to correct/review: plasmaPower, pressure, dosing/purge times, growth per cycle units/values, all flow rates, nucleationPeriod, refractiveIndex, absorption/optical details, all electrical properties, uniformity, conformality, film composition values, roughness value, film density, all deviceProperties, and otherAspects placeholders."

        "rationale": "The extracted process contains numerous inaccuracies, untraceable values, and unit/schema issues that significantly reduce completeness and fidelity to the article. Key problems: (1) Incorrect/unsupported parameters: growth per cycle recorded as 0.256 \u00c5 (article: ~0.256 nm \u2248 2.56 \u00c5); reactor pressure set to 1.01325 mmHg instead of atmospheric (~760 mmHg); dosing/purge times given as 15 and 10 with unit MilliSEC (article: 15 s and 10 s; should be 15000 ms and 10000 ms if using MilliSEC); flow rates assigned as 200 to precursor/co-reactant/purge with unit SCM-PER-MIN\u2014article only reports total flow 200 sccm and no per-stream values; unit SCM-PER-MIN is inconsistent with sccm magnitude. (2) Fabricated/untraceable properties: refractive index, absorption coefficient, all electrical properties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility), uniformity, conformality, film density (and XRR method), device properties (TFT metrics), and elemental concentration/atomic ratio (set to 50% and 1:1) are not reported in the article; safety, film stability, and reproducibility are not substantiated. (3) Schema issues: plasmaPower is set to null (should be omitted since PEALD not used); supercycleDesign included with empty arrays (not applicable for binary process); nucleationPeriod set to 1 cycle without support from the article. (4) Incomplete capture of reported experiments: the paper reports multiple films/conditions (e.g., 200 cycles at 400, 475, and 600 \u00b0C for AFM; epitaxial window 450\u2013550 \u00b0C; cycles 50\u20131200), but only one process instance is extracted. (5) Partial pressures and exposure-period ranges are central to this study; while the schema lacks explicit fields for partial pressure, the extraction does not reflect the reported ranges where possible (e.g., as comments or alternative fields) and misrepresents pressure altogether. To improve completeness: correct GPC to 2.56 \u00c5; correct pressure to ~760 mmHg; convert dosing/purge times to milliseconds; remove unreported material/electrical/device properties or mark as unavailable; avoid assigning per-stream flow rates not given; set nucleationPeriod appropriately (or omit if schema permits); add additional process instances for the different temperatures and cycle counts explicitly described; ensure all values are traceable to the article."
