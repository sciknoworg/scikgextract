        "rationale": "Accurate items: TALD method for ZnO, [Zn(eeki)2] with H2O, reactor (F-120 SAT ALCVD, ASM), substrate Si(100), 225 \u00b0C, pulse sequence 4\u201310\u20134\u201310 s, GPC ~1.3 \u00c5/cycle, 250 cycles, ~30 nm thickness, polycrystalline by GI-XRD, band gap 3.29 eV by UV-Vis/Tauc. Major issues: (1) Schema violation: plasmaPower set to null; omit if not PEALD. (2) Pressure incorrect and not traceable: article gives 0\u20133 mbar; extracted 1.5 mTorr (\u22480.002 mbar) and wrong unit/value; should convert to mTorr and use a representative value consistent with article. (3) Multiple unsourced/fabricated fields: flowRates (sccm), nucleationPeriod (5 cycles), refractiveIndex (1.96), absorptionCoefficient (0.04), electricalProperties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility, \u2018Hall measurements\u2019), uniformity (3.2%), conformality (AR=10), roughness (AFM 1.8 nm), filmDensity (XRR 5.6 g/dm\u00b3) \u2013 none are reported. (4) Film composition: atomicRatio value 1.08:1.0 is from XPS after sputter, but labeled as \u2018RBS and NRA\u2019; characterizationMethod should be XPS. ElementalConcentration given as a single 50% is ambiguous and not traceable to reported RBS/NRA (which list Zn/O ratios and C% at various T). (5) DeviceProperties (mobility, Vth, SS, on/off, device structure) are not in the paper. Corrections: remove or leave blank unsupported properties; fix pressure with correct unit conversion; remove plasmaPower or provide valid object only if PEALD; correct film composition method to XPS and align ratios with the text; ensure every numeric value is traceable to the article."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Several required fields are populated with values not supported by the article, there is at least one schema violation, and important reported process details are omitted. Key issues: (1) Schema violation: processParameters.plasmaPower is set to null; if PEALD was not used this field should be omitted, not null. (2) Invented/untraceable values: flowRates (sccm), nucleationPeriod (5 cycles), uniformity (3.2%), conformality aspect ratio (10), roughness (AFM 1.8 nm), filmDensity (XRR 5.6 g/dm3), refractiveIndex (1.96), absorptionCoefficient (0.04), and most electrical/deviceProperties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility, TFT metrics) are not reported in the paper. (3) Composition inconsistencies: elementalConcentration set to 50% with method \u2018RBS and NRA\u2019 oversimplifies temperature-dependent RBS/NRA results; atomicRatio \u20181.08:1.0\u2019 is attributed to \u2018RBS and NRA\u2019 but the 1.08 value stems from XPS after sputtering. (4) Pressure is given as a single 1.5 mmHg value without source; the article reports 0\u20133 mbar (range). (5) Process coverage gaps: only one process at 225 \u00b0C on Si(100) is captured; the article reports a temperature window (175\u2013300 \u00b0C), saturation thresholds (\u22651 s for precursor, \u22652 s for H2O), and separate depositions on quartz for optical data\u2014all not represented as additional processes or parameters. Correct elements include ZnO via thermal ALD with [Zn(eeki)2]/H2O, 4\u201310\u20134\u201310 s pulsing, ~1.3 \u00c5/cycle, polycrystalline ZnO and band gap 3.29 eV. To improve completeness, remove/rectify unsubstantiated fields, fix plasmaPower, attribute composition methods correctly, and add processes/parameters for the temperature window and quartz substrate used for optical characterization."
