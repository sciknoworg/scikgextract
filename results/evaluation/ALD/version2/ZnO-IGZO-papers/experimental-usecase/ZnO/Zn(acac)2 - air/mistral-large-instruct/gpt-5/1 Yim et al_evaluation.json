        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues. Key examples: (1) Dosing/purging times are wrong by orders of magnitude and units: article uses precursor dosing ~3 h and purge ~2 h in N2, and co\u2011reactant exposure is air at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h (100 mL/min) in a tube furnace; extraction reports 3 ms/2 ms doses and 2 ms purges (schema allows ms but values must reflect the article). (2) Pressure 5 mmHg is not reported for deposition; article mentions ~5 mbar for precursor sublimation, not the ALD reactor step\u2014thus not traceable. (3) Growth per cycle and film thickness (0.2 nm) are invented; the article reports areal number density (~2.2 Zn nm^-2), not thickness GPC. Also schema violation: growthPerCycle unit must be ANGSTROM, not NanoM. (4) Uniformity (0.15%), conformality aspect ratio (100), roughness (1.5 nm, AFM), film density (5.61 with GM-PER-DeciM3), and crystallinity \u201cpolycrystalline by XRD\u201d are not reported in the paper (XRD was for ZrO2 phase), hence untraceable. (5) Atomic ratio Zn:O = 1:1 (XPS) is not provided; XPS shows Zn2+ states but no Zn/O ratio. (6) Flow rates: article gives N2 carrier 100 sccm in reactor and synthetic air 100 mL/min in a separate furnace; extraction assigns 100 \u201cSCM-PER-MIN\u201d (wrong unit) for precursor/co\u2011reactant flows in the reactor. (7) Schema violations: plasmaPower, opticalProperties, electricalProperties, and deviceProperties fields are set to null though defined as objects; supercycleDesign is placed inside processParameters and set to null (invalid location and type). (8) NucleationPeriod = 1 cycle is not reported. Correct values traceable to the text: ALD method = TALD; material ZnO; precursor Zn(acac)2; co\u2011reactant synthetic air; carrier/purging gas N2; reactor F\u2011120 (ASM); substrate mesoporous ZrO2; temperature 200 \u00b0C for adsorption and 500 \u00b0C for oxidative ligand removal; saturation = true; zinc loading \u22481.2 wt% after 1 cycle (ICP\u2011OES). Properties to correct/review: dosingTime, purgeTime, pressure, growthPerCycle (and unit), filmThickness, flowRates (and units/context), uniformity/conformality/crystallinity/roughness/filmDensity, atomicRatio, nucleationPeriod, and remove/relocate null objects to meet schema."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect and incomplete relative to the article and violates multiple schema constraints. Key issues: (1) Many values are fabricated or mistyped and not traceable: dosingTime and purgeTime are given as 3 ms/2 ms, but the article reports 3 h precursor exposure and 2 h purge; co-reactant step is an oxidative ligand removal at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h in synthetic air, not a millisecond pulse. (2) FlowRates are misassigned: the article reports N2 carrier at 100 sccm and 100 mL/min synthetic air in a separate tube furnace; there is no \u201cprecursorFlow\u201d or \u201ccoReactantFlow\u201d in sccm as entered. (3) Pressure (5 mmHg) is misattributed; the 5 mbar value pertains to precursor sublimation, not reactor deposition pressure. (4) Growth per cycle and film thickness (0.2 nm) are not reported in the paper; only areal number density (~2.2 Zn/nm^2) is given. (5) Multiple unsupported material properties: uniformity (0.15%), conformality AR=100, crystallinity=polycrystalline by XRD, roughness (AFM), film density, and Zn:O=1:1 (XPS) are not provided in the article. (6) Device properties are set to null and many optional fields (plasmaPower, supercycleDesign) are present as null, violating schema type expectations; an extra filmThickness field is added at processParameters level (not defined in schema). (7) The article describes multiple processes/conditions (ALD temperatures 160\u2013240 \u00b0C, up to three cycles, varying support calcination), but only a single 200 \u00b0C, 1-cycle process is extracted; oxidation step details (500 \u00b0C, 2 h, 100 mL/min synthetic air) are not represented properly. Properties to add/review: correct dosing/purge/oxidation times with proper units (seconds), correct carrier/co-reactant flows as reported, remove unsupported GPC/thickness and material/device properties or replace with traceable values, fix pressure attribution, include separate process instances (or parameterized entries) for different temperatures and cycle counts, and remove null-valued objects to comply with the schema."
