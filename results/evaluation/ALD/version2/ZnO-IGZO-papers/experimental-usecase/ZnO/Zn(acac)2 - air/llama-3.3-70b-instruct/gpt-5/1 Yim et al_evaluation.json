        "rationale": "Largely incorrect and not schema-compliant. Key issues: (1) Many values are fabricated and not in the article: materialProperties (refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, electrical resistivity, carrier density, mobility, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, roughness, film density) and deviceProperties (mobility, threshold voltage, subthreshold swing, on/off ratio) were not measured or reported; XPS composition was not 50% nor Zn:O=1:1. (2) Misinterpretations and wrong units: growthPerCycle set to 2.2 nm (unit NanoM) but article reports areal number density 2.2 nm\u207b\u00b2 per cycle; schema requires ANGSTROM. filmThickness (2.2 nm) is unreported for powders and unjustified. dosingTime/purgeTime use ms but values are off by orders of magnitude (article uses 3 h dose and 2 h purge; correct would be 10,800,000 ms and 7,200,000 ms, not 18,000 ms and 7,200 ms). Co-reactant dosing is incorrectly modeled inside the ALD reactor; in the article ligand removal occurred ex situ in a tube furnace (500 \u00b0C, 2 h, 100 mL/min synthetic air). pressure set to 1 mmHg is unsupported; only a sublimation pressure (~5 mbar \u2248 3,750 mTorr) is given, not reactor deposition pressure. flowRates: 100 sccm assigned to precursor and co-reactant is misleading; article reports 100 sccm N2 carrier/purge in the reactor and 100 mL/min synthetic air in the furnace, not a precursor vapor flow or in-reactor co-reactant flow. crystallinity 'polycrystalline by XRD' is unsupported (XRD discussed ZrO2 phase; no ZnO crystallinity claimed). filmDensity given as 5.6 g/dm\u00b3 is physically wrong for ZnO (~5.6 g/cm\u00b3; in schema\u2019s unit GM-PER-DeciM3 it should be ~5600). (3) Schema violations: plasmaPower provided as null (type mismatch; omit if not PEALD), thicknessControl.growthPerCycle unit must be ANGSTROM, absorptionCoefficient unit must be UNITLESS per schema options, several required fields are populated with incorrect/unguarded values, and many entries are not traceable to the text. Properties to correct/review: processParameters.plasmaPower (omit), pressure, dosingTime/purgeTime, flowRates mapping, thicknessControl.growthPerCycle (value and unit), filmThickness (justify or remove), materialProperties (remove or replace with traceable values), filmComposition (use XPS values from Table 2 if applicable), crystallinity, deviceProperties (remove), filmDensity (unit/value). Overall, the extraction deviates substantially from the article and the schema."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect and incomplete relative to the article and the schema. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes are not represented: the paper reports many distinct runs (ALD temperatures 160\u2013240 \u00b0C, support calcination temperatures 400\u20131000 \u00b0C, and 1\u20133 ALD cycles), but only a single process at 200 \u00b0C is provided. (2) Core process parameters are wrong or untraceable: growthPerCycle is given as 2.2 nm (length) whereas the article reports ~2.2 nm^-2 areal number density per cycle; unit must be ANGSTROM per schema, and thickness per cycle was not reported. Film thickness (2.2 nm) is not reported in the paper. Dosing/purge times are off by orders of magnitude (3 h and 2 h in the article vs 18 s and 7.2 s provided in ms). Co-reactant use is misrepresented: ligand removal was done ex situ in a tube furnace at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h with 100 mL/min synthetic air, not as an in-reactor pulse; the provided co-reactant flow/time are unsupported. Pressure (1 mmHg) is not reported. Plasma power is set to null (schema violation). (3) Material and device properties are fabricated: refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, mobility, uniformity, conformality (AR), roughness, film density, crystallinity (for ZnO by XRD), and all TFT device metrics are not reported in the article. Film composition is incorrect: XPS shows Zn ~3.8\u20135.2 at% with significant Zr and O; a 50% value and Zn:O=1:1 ratio are not supported. (4) Additional schema/units issues: growthPerCycle unit must be ANGSTROM (not NanoM); dosing/purge times must reflect 3 h and 2 h (10,800,000 ms and 7,200,000 ms); flow units and values are inconsistent with the article (e.g., co-reactant flow given as 100 sccm while article uses 100 mL/min in a separate furnace step). To improve: represent each experimental process (temperature series, calcination series, and cycle count 1\u20133) as separate processes; correct dosing/purge times; model the ex situ oxidation step appropriately; remove unreported optical/electrical/device properties; populate composition from XPS (Table 2) and ensure all units match the schema (e.g., GPC in \u00c5 if derived)."
