        "rationale": "Large portions of the extracted record are fabricated or not traceable to the article, and several values are physically inconsistent despite being schema-compliant. Only a few items match the text: ZnO was deposited by PEALD at 200 \u00b0C, with DEZ as precursor and N2O as oxidant, and film thickness ~11 nm. Key issues: (1) Unsupported process parameters: plasmaPower (100 W), pressure (10 MilliM_HG), deliveryMethod, carrierGas/purgingGas (N2), reactor details, growth-per-cycle (0.3 \u00c5), number of cycles (367), saturation=True, nucleationPeriod=5 cycles, dosing/purge times (100 ms), and flow rates (10/50 sccm equivalent) are not reported anywhere in the paper. (2) Substrate mis-specified: listed as \u201c300 mm silicon wafers,\u201d while the ZnO was deposited onto the Al0.88B0.12N/W/Pt/Ti/Si stack after removing the top W (the article\u2019s described stack), not bare Si. (3) SupercycleDesign fields (sequence ['DEZ','N2O']) are not described by the authors. (4) Material properties for ZnO (refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, crystallinity \u201camorphous\u201d by XRD, roughness, density, composition by XPS, uniformity, conformality) and methods (UV-Vis, AFM, XRR, XPS) are not provided in the article; XRD shown is for Al0.88B0.12N, not ZnO. Density is also unit-inconsistent: 5.6 GM/DeciM3 equals 5.6 g/L, not 5.6 g/cm3; this is physically incorrect and not traceable. (5) Device properties (mobility 10 cm2/Vs, threshold 0.5 V, SS 150 mV, on/off 1e6, structure) are not reported. The article instead reports FeFET memory window (>1 V) and switching voltages (\u2264 \u00b110 V) and V_on behavior, which are absent from the extraction. (6) Flow-rate units use SCM-PER-MIN (standard cubic meters per minute), yielding unrealistic magnitudes and are not in the paper. To correct, retain only article-backed values (PEALD, 200 \u00b0C, DEZ/N2O, ZnO thickness ~11 nm, deposition on Al0.88B0.12N/W/Pt/Ti/Si), and remove or mark unknown all unreported parameters; update substrate description accordingly; do not invent optical/electrical/structural properties or device metrics not given by the authors."

        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely non-traceable and omits key processes. The article reports two PEALD depositions at 200 \u00b0C: ZnO (DEZ/N2O) and Al2O3 (TMA/CO2), yet only a single ZnO process is provided and no separate Al2O3 process is extracted. Many values are fabricated without support from the text, violating traceability and schema-guided rigor: plasma power (100 W), reactor manufacturer, pressure (10 mTorr), carrier/purging gas (N2), dosing/purge times, flow rates, growth-per-cycle (0.3 \u00c5) and number of cycles (367), saturation and nucleation period, supercycle sequence, and delivery method\u2014all not reported. MaterialProperties are extensively invented (refractive index, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, mobility, uniformity, conformality, composition by XPS, crystallinity \u201camorphous\u201d by XRD, roughness by AFM, density by XRR), none of which are stated for the ZnO film in the article; XRD shown pertains to Al0.88B0.12N, not ZnO. DeviceProperties (\u03bcFE, VTH, SS, ION/IOFF) are also not reported; conversely, reported device metrics (memory window >1 V and Vswitch \u2264 \u00b110 V) are not captured. The substrate is misrepresented as \u201c300 mm silicon wafers,\u201d whereas the ZnO was deposited on a 3 nm Al2O3 interlayer over the Al0.88B0.12N/Pt/Ti/Si stack after W removal. Overall, the extraction fails completeness and factual alignment; it should add a separate Al2O3 PEALD process and restrict values to those explicitly reported (PEALD method, DEZ/N2O, TMA/CO2, 200 \u00b0C, 11 nm ZnO thickness, stack context, and the FeFET memory/switching metrics if mapped), removing all unsupported parameters."
