        "rationale": "Schema violations and extensive ungrounded data. Schema issues: (1) plasmaPower is null\u2014omit it for thermal ALD or supply a valid object only if PEALD; (2) supercycleDesign is set to null\u2014if included it must be an object with subcycleSequence, otherwise omit; (3) filmThickness is incorrectly nested inside thicknessControl.growthPerCycle (additionalProperties are not allowed there) and also duplicated at processParameters level. Factual misalignments/unsupported values: pressure (0.1 mmHg), numberofCycles (1000) and filmThickness (180 nm), dosing times (100 ms), flow rates, saturation, nucleationPeriod, uniformity, conformality, XPS composition/atomic ratio, film density, refractive index/absorption/band gap and Tauc method, device metrics (field-effect mobility, threshold voltage, subthreshold swing, device structure) are not reported in the article. Electrical properties: carrierDensity is given as 1e16 m^-3, which contradicts the article\u2019s ~1e16 cm^-3 (\u22481e22 m^-3); mobility 100 cm^2/V\u00b7s is not supported for DEZn in this work. Device on/off ratio 1e7 at 1.5 V pertains to a Schottky junction, not a TFT as encoded. Correct items include: TALD with DEZn + H2O, Savannah-100 (Cambridge NanoTech), Si substrate, 130 \u00b0C, GPC \u22481.8 \u00c5/cycle, polycrystalline (XRD), AFM roughness \u22481.5 nm, and Hall/van der Pauw. To correct: remove or revise unsupported values; fix unit/magnitude for carrier density; limit deviceProperties to the reported Schottky metric or omit; and repair schema-violating fields."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and not schema-faithful to the article. Multiple distinct processes reported (DEZn/H2O, DMZn/H2O, and zinc acetate/H2O, using two reactors: Savannah-100 and F-120) are collapsed into a single process; separate process objects should be created with their own temperature windows and parameters. Many values are fabricated or not traceable to the text: carrier/purging gas type (Ar), reactor pressure, number of cycles, film thickness, saturation, nucleation period, dosing/flow rates, refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap (Tauc), resistivity, detailed composition (XPS), density, uniformity, conformality, TFT-specific device metrics (field-effect mobility, Vth, SS, device structure). Several values conflict with the article: carrier density is given as 1e16 m^-3 (orders of magnitude below the reported ~1e16 cm^-3), and the on/off ratio belongs to a Schottky junction rather than a TFT. Some parts are correct (TALD with DEZn/H2O, ~1.8 \u00c5/cycle, polycrystalline, AFM roughness ~1.5 nm at 130 \u00b0C, Hall method), but schema issues remain: nulls provided for object-typed fields (plasmaPower, supercycleDesign), and thicknessControl does not match the schema\u2019s required fields. To improve: add separate process entries for DEZn, DMZn, and zinc acetate; remove or mark unknown any unreported parameters (gases, pressure, cycles, flows, optical constants, density, uniformity/conformality); correct carrier density units/magnitude; represent device results as Schottky diode performance rather than TFT metrics; include both reactors where applicable; ensure no nulls for object fields and align thicknessControl with schema requirements."
