        "rationale": "Several core fields are correct and traceable (PEALD for In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO; precursors DEZ/TMGa/InCp; O2 plasma co-reactant; reactor Picosun R200 advanced; plasma power 2500 W; substrate glass; temperature 250 \u00b0C; film thickness 30 nm; device metrics Vth=1.7 V, \u03bc_FE=8.8 cm^2/Vs, ION/IOFF\u22482.2\u00d710^8; amorphous by XRD/HRTEM). However, many entries are unreported, incorrect, or inconsistent with the article and/or the schema intent: 1) reactantSelection.carrierGas and purgingGas set to Ar are not reported; 2) processParameters.deliveryMethod, pressure (10 mTorr), dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, saturation, nucleationPeriod, growthPerCycle values are not given in the paper; these appear fabricated; 3) thicknessControl.numberofCycles is set to 39 but the article states 39 supercycles; the total ALD cycles per supercycle are 8 (ZnO+Ga2O3 once, then 3\u00d7(ZnO+In2O3)), so total ALD cycles should be 312; 4) supercycleDesign.numberofSubcycles undercounts ZnO (reported as 1; should reflect 4 ZnO cycles per supercycle) and the subcycleSequence omits the repeated ZnO before each In2O3; 5) materialProperties.electricalProperties.mobility=8.8 cm^2/Vs with characterizationMethod \"Hall-effect\" conflicts with the text (Hall mobility up to 19.2 cm^2/Vs for 35% In2O3); 8.8 cm^2/Vs belongs to device field-effect mobility; 6) deviceProperties.subthresholdSwing uses 0.2 with unit MilliV (0.2 mV), but the article reports 0.2 V/dec; this should be 200 mV to comply with the schema unit; 7) filmComposition.elementalConcentration provides 12.4% without specifying element and omits reported Ga=7.8%; atomicRatio '1.0:2.8:5.4' is not reported; 8) opticalProperties (n, absorption, band gap), uniformity, conformality, roughness, filmDensity are not provided in the article; filmDensity unit/value are also physically implausible and ungrounded; 9) Only one process is extracted despite three reported IGZO conditions (0%, 20%, 35% In2O3 cycle ratios). Properties to correct/review: carrier/purging gases; pressure; dosing/purge times and flow rates; growth-per-cycle; numberofCycles (use total ALD cycles); supercycleDesign counts/sequence; materialProperties mobilities and carrier density; subthreshold swing unit/value; film composition (include In 12.4% and Ga 7.8% with traceability); remove or substantiate optical/roughness/density/uniformity/conformality; and include separate processes for 0% and 20% conditions."

        "rationale": "Multiple IGZO ALD processes are described in the article (0%, 20%, and 35% In2O3 cycle ratios), but only one process is extracted (IGZO35%). Key elements are either missing or not traceable to the text, and several parameters appear guessed. Specific issues: (1) Missing processes: separate structured processes for IGZO 0% (GZO) and IGZO 20% including their supercycle designs and TFT performance (Vth = 3.7 V, \u22120.7 V; ION/IOFF = 1.3\u00d710^5, 1.6\u00d710^7; SS ~1.0 and intermediate value; mobility trend). (2) Supercycle design for IGZO35% is misrepresented: the article states a two-subcycle pattern (1\u00d7ZnO+1\u00d7Ga2O3, followed by 3\u00d7ZnO+1\u00d7In2O3) and 39 supercycles for 30 nm; the extraction collapses this to counts {ZnO:1, Ga2O3:1, In2O3:3} and a simple sequence, losing the two-subcycle structure and the repeated ZnO detail; IGZO20% design (21 supercycles with specified sub-cycles) is omitted. (3) Many process parameters are not reported in the article yet filled: pressure, deliveryMethod, dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, nucleationPeriod, saturation; these are not traceable. Carrier/purging gas (Ar) is also not stated. (4) Material properties: refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, roughness, and film density are not reported; atomic ratio (1.0:2.8:5.4) is not supported by the text; elemental concentration is given as 12.4% but unlabeled to an element (should be clearly In at.%). (5) Electrical properties: the extraction labels mobility 8.8 cm^2/Vs as Hall (method = Hall), but 8.8 cm^2/Vs is the device \u03bc_sat; Hall mobility for the film at 35% is reported up to 19.2 cm^2/Vs. (6) Device properties: SS is given as 0.2 mV (per schema\u2019s unit), whereas the article reports 0.2 V/dec; unit/value pairing is inconsistent. To improve completeness: add separate processes for 0%, 20%, and 35% In2O3 cases; correct the supercycle designs and counts; restrict parameters to those reported or mark as unsupported; fix device SS units/value, correctly separate Hall vs device mobility, and clearly label elemental concentrations."
