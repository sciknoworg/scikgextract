        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues. (1) Misattributed parameters: temperature (200 \u00b0C) and plasma power (100 W) are reported in the article for Al2O3 (GI) and SiO2 (GI) depositions, respectively, not for IGZO PEALD; IGZO deposition temperature and plasma power are not given. (2) Schema violations and placeholders: pressure has null numericValue/unit; purgingGas set to 'Not Found'; reactor name/manufacturer 'Not Found'; thicknessControl.growthPerCycle = null; supercycleDesign = null; multiple subfields (uniformity, conformality, roughness, filmDensity) contain nulls or 'Not Found'; dosingTime, purgeTime, and flowRates are empty arrays. The schema requires valid values with QUDT-compliant units and prohibits empty/nulls. (3) Subthreshold swing unit error: article reports 0.20 V/dec, but the JSON uses 0.2 with unit MilliV; should be 200 mV/dec to comply with schema. (4) Untraceable entries: carrierGas 'Ar', saturation=false, otherAspects.filmStability=true and reproducibility=true are not supported by the text. (5) Film/electrical property mix-up: materialProperties.electricalProperties.mobility repeats a device metric rather than a film (Hall) value and has 'characterizationMethod' as 'Not Found'. (6) Supercycle design missing: IGZO is a multicomponent ALD; article gives cation ratio 2:1:1.3 but no subcycle counts; providing supercycleDesign=null violates type; if included, it must be a valid object. Correct values include: materialDeposited=InGaZnO, substrate=glass, filmThickness=20 nm, PEALD method, precursors (DADI, TMGa, DEZ), co-reactant Ar/O2 plasma, device metrics for device D (\u03bcFE=28.17 cm^2/V\u00b7s, Vth=0.96 V). To correct: remove or properly fill unknown fields (pressure, gases, reactor), fix SS to 200 mV, omit optional sections rather than using null/'Not Found', do not misattribute SiO2/Al2O3 parameters to IGZO, and either supply a valid supercycle design or omit the property."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Several correct elements are captured (IGZO PEALD, precursors DADI/TMGa/DEZ, Ar/O2 plasma co-reactant, 20 nm IGZO thickness, amorphous phase, cation ratio 2:1:1.3, device D metrics), but the extraction is incomplete and has multiple schema violations and some misassignments. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes described in the article (ALD SiO2 at 250\u00b0C with DIPAS and 100 W Ar/O2 plasma; ALD Al2O3 with TMA/H2O at 200\u00b0C; IGZO PEALD; and different device stacks A\u2013E) are reduced to a single process, omitting separate ALD processes and device variants. (2) Required schema fields contain nulls/placeholders: processParameters.pressure (numericValue/unit/quantityKind are null), thicknessControl.nucleationPeriod has nulls, uniformity.variation, conformality.aspectRatio, roughness.value, filmDensity.value and deviceProperties.onOffRatio are null; purgingGas is \u201cNot Found.\u201d These violate the schema\u2019s non-null requirements. (3) Misassigned or unsupported values: temperature set to 200\u00b0C (this is for Al2O3 GI; IGZO deposition temperature is not reported); plasmaPower 100 W is reported for SiO2, not specified for IGZO; subthresholdSwing uses mV units but numericValue 0.2 corresponds to 0.2 mV (should be 200 mV for 0.20 V/dec per schema), and carrier/purging gases are not traceable. (4) Missing IGZO supercycleDesign (subcycleSequence and counts a:b:c) despite composition control being central to IGZO ALD. (5) materialProperties.electricalProperties.mobility duplicates device mobility without a characterization method (no Hall data reported). To improve completeness, add separate processes for ALD SiO2, ALD Al2O3, and IGZO; include device properties for devices A\u2013E (including device E with stacked GI); supply valid pressure, purging/carrier gases, dosing/purge/flow details if available; provide a valid supercycle design; correct SS units; and remove all null/\u201cNot Found\u201d placeholders or replace with article-backed values."
