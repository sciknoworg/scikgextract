        "rationale": "Several key fields are correct (PEALD for In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO; precursors DADI/TMGa/DEZ; O2 plasma reactant; Ar carrier/purge gas; 100 W plasma power; 200 \u00b0C; ~1.2 Torr; supercycle 6:1:1; TG-BC device metrics Vth\u22480.05 V, \u03bcFE\u224827.6 cm2/Vs, SS\u224861 mV/dec). However, many values are incorrect, untraceable, or mixed from a different ALD process (Al2O3 GI) and thus violate factual alignment and coherence: (1) Dosing/purge times (0.1 s, 5 s; 25 s, 20 s) are for Al2O3 GI, not IGZO sub-cycles, and units are wrong (entered as milliseconds). (2) Flow rates (10 \u2018SCM-PER-MIN\u2019) are fabricated; no flow data reported. (3) GPC values (0.9 \u00c5/cycle) are taken from Al2O3 trends and not reported for In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO in this work. (4) ThicknessControl uses filmThickness=30 nm (stacked-film characterization) while deviceProperties correspond to 8 nm IGZO devices; numberofCycles=1 is implausible and unreported\u2014this is internally inconsistent. (5) Optical properties: refractive index 1.62 pertains to Al2O3, not IGZO; absorption coefficient is not reported; band-gap method listed as \u201cTauc plot\u201d whereas the article used SE (not explicitly Tauc). (6) Electrical film properties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility as Hall) are not reported; the 27.6 cm2/Vs value is a device metric, not Hall. (7) Film density 3.12 g/cm3 is for Al2O3 GI, not IGZO. (8) Composition: atomic ratio \u20181.0:2.8:5.4\u2019 and \u2018XPS depth profile\u2019 are incorrect; the paper reports In0.52:Ga0.18:Zn0.30 by XRF. (9) Uniformity (1%) and conformality data are not provided. (10) Supercycle subcycleSequence is underspecified (only a list of compounds, not the explicit sequence), and reactor name is set to the manufacturer. To correct: remove or mark as not reported dosing/purge times, flows, GPC, nucleationPeriod, uniformity, conformality, resistivity, carrier density, absorption coefficient, on/off ratio; set film thickness consistently (8 nm for device-centric process) and avoid mixing with the 30 nm stacked film; correct composition to In0.52:Ga0.18:Zn0.30 with XRF; remove Al2O3 properties (RI, density) from the IGZO process; if Al2O3 GI is to be captured, extract it as a separate ALD process with its own parameters."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect and not schema/article-aligned. Key issues: (1) Mixed processes: parameters and properties from Al2O3 GI ALD (TMA/O3, RI\u22481.62, density\u22483.12 g/cm3, dosing/purge times) are incorrectly assigned to the IGZO ALD process. The article describes two distinct ALD processes (PEALD-IGZO at 200 \u00b0C, 1.2 Torr, O2 plasma 100 W; and Al2O3 ALD with TMA/O3 at 200\u2013400 \u00b0C, 350 mTorr with explicit dose/purge times). These must be represented as separate processes; instead, they are merged, breaking semantic coherence. (2) Dosing/purge times: the provided values (0.1, 5, 25, 20) s belong to Al2O3 GI (Section 2.2) but are placed under In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO sub-cycles. Moreover, units are wrong: the schema uses MilliSEC but the numeric values were not converted (e.g., 0.1 s should be 100 ms, 5 s \u2192 5000 ms). IGZO sub-cycle times are not reported in the article and should not be fabricated. (3) Growth per cycle: 0.9 \u00c5/cycle for In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO is not reported; the only GPC given (0.90\u21920.82 \u00c5/cycle) is for Al2O3 (Figure S5a). (4) numberofCycles = 1 is incorrect/unsupported; total cycles are not reported and cannot be inferred reliably. (5) Film thickness: 30 nm is that of the non-patterned stacked a\u2011IGZO film used for analyses (Section 3.1/2.4), while the device active layer is 8 nm (Section 2.3). The extraction mixes these into one process; separate processes are required. (6) Material properties: refractive index 1.62 and film density 3.12 g/cm3 are for Al2O3 (Figure S5a,S6), not IGZO; assigning them to IGZO is wrong. The density unit used (GM-PER-DeciM3) also mismatches the reported g/cm3 magnitude. (7) Band gap: 2.8 eV is traceable for IGZO, but the method is SE/XPS (Figure 1c), not \u201cTauc plot.\u201d (8) Electrical properties (film resistivity, carrier density, Hall mobility) are not reported; conductivity values shown are device-level and the extraction\u2019s values and \u201cHall measurements\u201d method are unsupported. (9) Film composition: the reported cation composition is In0.52 Ga0.18 Zn0.30 O (XRF); the extraction\u2019s atomic ratio \u201c1.0:2.8:5.4\u201d is incorrect and not traceable. (10) Uniformity (thickness %) and conformality (aspect ratio) are not reported; values provided are invented. (11) Device on/off ratio is not given in the text provided; the 1e6 value lacks grounding. Corrections needed: split into at least two processes (IGZO PEALD and Al2O3 ALD) and, if needed, separate the 30 nm stack vs. 8 nm device IGZO; remove or clearly ground dosing/purge/flow/GPC/film density/RI to the correct material; fix time units; use the reported composition (In0.52:Ga0.18:Zn0.30); set band gap method to SE/XPS; include only device metrics that are reported (\u03bc_FE 27.6 cm2/Vs, V_TH 0.05 V, SS 61 mV/dec, TG\u2011BC)."
