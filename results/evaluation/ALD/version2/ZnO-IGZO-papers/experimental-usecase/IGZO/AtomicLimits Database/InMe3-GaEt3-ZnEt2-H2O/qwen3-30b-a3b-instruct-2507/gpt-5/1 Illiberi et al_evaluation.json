        "rationale": "The extraction contains numerous factual errors, unverifiable values, and schema issues. Key problems: (1) thicknessControl.growthPerCycle: value assigned to InGaZnO (0.18 \u00c5) is incorrect; the article reports ~0.18 nm/cycle for ZnO, not IGZO, and the unit is off by 10\u00d7. thicknessControl.numberofCycles=1400 and filmThickness=250 nm correspond to ZnO, not IGZO; inconsistent with the stated IGZO process. (2) supercycleDesign: a 1:1:1 ZnO/InOx/GaOx supercycle is fabricated; the article explicitly used SALD with coinjection of DEZ, TMIn, TEGa and spatially separated H2O (no supercycle). (3) purgeTime: SALD does not use time\u2011sequenced purge steps (\u201cTime-consuming purge steps are no longer needed\u201d); providing 120 ms purges is incorrect. (4) flowRates: values (100 and 50 SCM/min) are not reported and are physically unrealistic; the article provides partial pressures (e.g., DEZ 1.96 mbar; TMIn up to 0.25 mbar; TEGa up to 0.37 mbar), not flow rates in sccm/SCM. (5) plasmaPower: set to null, violating the schema (should be omitted if not PEALD). (6) pressure: 760 mmHg is not explicitly reported; only \u201cspatial atmospheric ALD\u201d is stated; thus not traceable. (7) materialProperties: refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, roughness, film density, uniformity, and conformality values are not reported in the article and appear fabricated; filmDensity also uses an implausible unit (g/dm\u00b3) yielding an unphysical value for IGZO. (8) electricalProperties under materialProperties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility by Hall) are not reported; the 3.5 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s value is a device-level \u03bc_FE, not a Hall mobility. (9) deviceProperties: \u03bc_FE \u2248 3.5 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s and V_TH \u2248 \u221225 V are consistent; however, subthreshold swing and on/off ratio are not reported. (10) reactantSelection.coReactant only listed once for InGaZnO; while acceptable, the article clearly uses H2O for all metals; more explicit per-compound entries would be better. (11) dosingTime of 120 ms is within the reported 20\u2013120 ms range and is acceptable. To improve, remove supercycleDesign and purgeTime, correct GPC (or attribute it to ZnO), avoid fabricated flow/optical/roughness/density/electrical values, omit plasmaPower, and align film thickness and cycles with the actual IGZO conditions reported."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Major omissions, incorrect mappings, and non-traceable/fabricated values. Specific issues: (1) Multiple processes missing: the article reports separate SALD processes for ZnO, InZnO, and InGaZnO, but only a single IGZO process is extracted. (2) Growth-per-cycle and thickness misassigned: 0.18 nm/cycle is for ZnO, not IGZO; the JSON records 0.18 \u00c5 for IGZO and uses 250 nm after 1400 cycles, which corresponds to ZnO, whereas coinjected In(Zn)O/IGZO films show lower/nonlinear growth and ~60 nm after 1400 cycles at TMIn=0.25 mbar with DEZ=1.96 mbar. Also, filmThickness is duplicated/inconsistent (250 nm vs 15 nm). (3) SupercycleDesign is inapplicable: the article explicitly uses coinjection of metal precursors in the same deposition region (not supercycles); the provided 1:1:1 subcycles and sequence are not reported. (4) PurgeTime and FlowRates are not traceable: S-ALD removes time-consuming purge steps; the article gives exposure times (20\u2013120 ms) and precursor partial pressures (e.g., DEZ 1.96 mbar, TMIn up to 0.25 mbar, TEGa up to 0.37 mbar), not sccm flow rates; the JSON\u2019s sccm values appear fabricated. (5) Reactant lists are incomplete/misaligned: coReactant is given only for InGaZnO rather than per compound (ZnO, InOx, GaOx), despite water being used for all. (6) Material properties largely fabricated: refractive index, absorption, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, uniformity, conformality, roughness, and film density are not reported in the article; the JSON supplies unreferenced values. (7) Device properties partly correct but partly unreported: \u03bc_FE \u2248 3.5 cm2/V\u00b7s and negative onset (~\u221225 V) are consistent, but subthreshold swing and on/off ratio are not given in the article; their values look fabricated. (8) Schema issues: plasmaPower is set to null (wrong type; should be omitted); thicknessControl mixes ZnO and IGZO data; coReactant/precursor entries should be per compound; internal inconsistencies (duplicate film thickness). To improve completeness: add separate processes for ZnO, InZnO, and IGZO; correct GPC and thickness assignments; remove supercycleDesign; replace sccm flows with reported partial pressures (or leave flowRates unreported if schema allows); remove purgeTime or set to 0 ms with justification; include coReactant=H2O for each compound; ensure all numeric values are traceable to the article."
