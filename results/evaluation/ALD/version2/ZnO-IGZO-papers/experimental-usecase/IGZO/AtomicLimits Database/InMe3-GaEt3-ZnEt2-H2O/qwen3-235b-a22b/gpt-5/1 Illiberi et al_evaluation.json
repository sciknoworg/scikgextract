    "correctness": {
        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Several core elements are correct and traceable (SALD method; precursors DEZ/TMIn/TEGa with H2O; Ar carrier gas; 200 \u00b0C; atmospheric pressure; nucleation period \u2248200 cycles; bottom-gate top-contact TFT; field-effect mobility \u22483.5 cm2/V\u00b7s). However, there are multiple inaccuracies, unsupported assumptions, and schema violations: (1) Schema violations: multiple fields are set to null though the schema expects objects (plasmaPower, materialProperties.opticalProperties.refractiveIndex/absorptionCoefficient/bandGap, materialProperties.electricalProperties.resistivity/carrierDensity, deviceProperties.subthresholdSwing/onOffRatio). These should be omitted if not reported. (2) FlowRates: values (1.96, 0.25, 0.37) are partial pressures (mbar) from the article, not sccm flows; assigning them to sccm is incorrect and not traceable. (3) Film thickness: 250 nm corresponds to ZnO after 1400 cycles, not IGZO; the IGZO films used for TFTs were 15 nm. Using 250 nm for the IGZO process is incorrect. (4) SupercycleDesign: the article explicitly uses coinjection of metal precursors, not supercycles; this section should be omitted. (5) Growth per cycle for InZnO (1.5 \u00c5) and InGaZnO (1.2 \u00c5) are not reported numerically; only qualitative decrease vs composition is given. (6) Saturation set to True is not supported for IGZO (nonideal growth reported); at best this holds for ZnO only. (7) PurgingGas set to Argon is not stated; SALD eliminates purge steps; value is not traceable. (8) Film composition elementalConcentration set to 0% is incorrect; atomicRatio 20:8:72 is reasonable from In=20%, Ga=8%, Zn (by difference) but should be clearly tied to that device; elemental concentrations per element are otherwise not provided. (9) Uniformity variation 0%, conformality aspectRatio 0, roughness 0 nm, and filmDensity 0 are not reported and should not be filled with zeros. (10) Device thresholdVoltage \u221225 V is taken from onset voltage; threshold values vary with composition (Fig. 4b) and \u221225 V is not explicitly given as Vth for the cited device. To improve correctness, remove null fields or populate with supported values, correct flow units or omit flows, remove supercycleDesign, correct film thickness to 15 nm for the TFT IGZO case (or report thickness per experiment), avoid unreported GPC and uniformity/conformality/roughness/density values, and report Vth from Figure 4b for the given composition or omit if not specified."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Largely incomplete and partly incorrect relative to both the article and the schema. Key issues: (1) Missing processes: the article reports distinct SALD depositions of ZnO, InZnO, and InGaZnO; only one (IGZO) process is extracted. Separate processes for ZnO and InZnO (with their own parameters, GPC, thickness) are absent. (2) Flow rates: values given (1.96, 0.25, 0.37) are partial pressures (mbar) from the article, but are incorrectly entered as flow rates with unit SCM-PER-MIN, violating factual alignment and unit validity. (3) Supercycle design: the article uses coinjection of metal precursors (no subcycle sequence); the provided supercycle (1:1:1 with sequence InOx\u2192GaOx\u2192ZnO) is not reported and is misleading. (4) Thickness/GPC: filmThickness = 250 nm and GPC values for InZnO (1.5 \u00c5) and IGZO (1.2 \u00c5) are not supported; 250 nm after 1400 cycles corresponds to pure ZnO, not IGZO, and the article does not provide numeric GPC for InZnO/IGZO. (5) Device metrics: thresholdVoltage is set to \u221225 V, but the text states this as onset voltage; Vth for that composition is not explicitly given. (6) Schema compliance: numerous fields are populated with nulls or placeholders that violate the schema or are untraceable (e.g., plasmaPower = null; opticalProperties, resistivity, carrierDensity, subthresholdSwing, onOffRatio set to null; uniformity = 0%, conformality aspectRatio = 0, roughness = 0 nm, filmDensity = 0; \u2018safety\u2019 and \u2018reproducibility\u2019 asserted without support). (7) Purging gas: SALD eliminates purge steps; \u2018purgingGas = Argon\u2019 is not stated; purgeTime = 0 ms is reasonable but the gas itself is not reported. To improve: add separate ZnO and InZnO processes; correct or omit flowRates (or provide actual flow units/values if reported); remove supercycleDesign (or mark N/A) for coinjection SALD; correct filmThickness/GPC per material; provide only supported device metrics; replace null/placeholder values with supported data or omit optional fields; ensure all quantities use QUDT-compliant, article-aligned units."
