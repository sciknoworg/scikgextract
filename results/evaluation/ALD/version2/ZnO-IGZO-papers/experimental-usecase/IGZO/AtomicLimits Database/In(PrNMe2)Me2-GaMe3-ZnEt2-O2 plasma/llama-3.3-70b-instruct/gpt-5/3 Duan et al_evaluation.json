However, there are multiple schema violations, missing/unsupported values, and one clear unit error: (1) Growth-per-cycle is wrong by 10\u00d7: article reports 0.21 nm/cycle, but extraction gives 0.21 \u00c5 (should be 2.1 \u00c5). (2) Many numericValue fields are set to null (pressure, numberofCycles, filmThickness in multiple places, nucleationPeriod, dosing/purge times, flow rates, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, roughness, density, electrical properties, onOffRatio), which violates the schema (numeric types required) and the no-empty-values rule. (3) Uniformity is missing despite article reporting 1.26% (should populate materialProperties.uniformity.variation = 1.26%). (4) filmComposition.atomicRatio is set to 1:1:1 without a characterization method; the article discusses cycle ratio, not measured atomic ratios\u2014this misuses the property. (5) Substrate is set to \u201cSi wafer\u201d without explicit support in the text (only \u201c8-in wafer\u201d is mentioned); this should be corrected or left unspecified if allowed. (6) carrierGas and purgingGas are populated as \u201cNot Found,\u201d which does not satisfy the requirement for actual gases; same issue for many \u2018Not Found\u2019 placeholders. (7) saturation is set to False without evidence. (8) Crystallinity \u201camorphous\u201d is not explicitly stated or characterized in the text. To improve, correct the GPC unit/value, remove unsupported assumptions, fill traceable values (e.g., uniformity 1.26%), and either supply valid measured values or omit optional properties; ensure all required numeric fields have valid numbers per schema or are supported by the article."

        "rationale": "Several key fields are correctly extracted (PEALD for InOx/GaOx/ZnOx, IGZO as material, DADI/TMGa/DEZ precursors, O2 plasma co\u2011reactant, reactor TFS200, deposition temperature 250 \u00b0C, plasma power 38 W, supercycle 1:1:1, device Vth \u2248 \u22123.5 V and SS \u2248 230 mV/dec), but many required schema elements are missing, null, or not grounded, and there are factual inconsistencies: (1) Required process parameters contain nulls: pressure.numericValue = null; thicknessControl.numberofCycles.numericValue = null; thicknessControl.filmThickness.numericValue = null; processParameters.filmThickness.numericValue = null; nucleationPeriod.numericValue = null; dosingTime/purgeTime/flowRates numeric values = null. The schema requires these fields and no null values. (2) GPC unit/value error: article states ~0.21 nm/cycle (Fig. 5a), but extraction reports 0.21 \u00c5/cycle (10\u00d7 too small). (3) Uniformity missing: article reports 1\u03c3 = 1.26% on an 8\u2011in wafer (Fig. 5b); uniformity.variation should capture 1.26% but is null. (4) Saturation set to False without support in the article. (5) filmComposition.atomicRatio set to 1:1:1 without a characterization method; the article varies cycle ratios but does not report measured atomic ratios. (6) Substrate set to \"Si wafer\" is not explicitly stated; only \"8\u2011in wafer\" is mentioned. (7) OtherAspects set filmStability = False and reproducibility = False without evidence. (8) Material properties (optical, resistivity, carrier density, mobility, roughness, density, conformality aspect ratio) are largely unreported in the article yet included as nulls. (9) On/off ratio can be derived from ION > 30 \u00b5A/\u00b5m and IOFF < 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2077 A/\u00b5m but is left null. To improve completeness, fill pressure (if available), correct GPC to 0.21 nm (2.1 \u00c5), add uniformity 1.26%, remove/justify unsupported fields (substrate, saturation, filmStability/reproducibility), omit measured atomic ratio or provide actual characterization, and either provide or omit (per schema allowances) dosing/purge/flow/nucleation/film thickness values based on the article; compute on/off ratio or state a lower bound based on reported currents."
