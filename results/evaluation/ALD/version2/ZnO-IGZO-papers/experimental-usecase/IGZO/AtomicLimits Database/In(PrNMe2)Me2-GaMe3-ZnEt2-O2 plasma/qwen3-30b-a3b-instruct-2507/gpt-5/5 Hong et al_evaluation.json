Key issues:\n- Dosing times: Article gives precursor dose times of 1.5 s (DADI) and 0.1 s (TMGa, DEZ); extraction uses milliseconds but with the same numeric values (1.5 ms and 0.1 ms), off by 10^3. If using MilliSEC per schema, values should be ~1500 ms (DADI) and 100 ms (TMGa, DEZ). Co-reactant dose times are not reported in the article but set to 100 ms\u2014ungrounded.\n- Purge times and flow rates: Not reported in the article; values (10 ms purges; 10/50/100 sccm) are invented.\n- Growth per cycle (GPC), number of cycles: Not provided in the article (GPC in Figure S1 only); values (0.1 \u00c5/cycle; 100 cycles) are unsubstantiated.\n- Carrier/purging gas: Article does not explicitly specify carrier or purge gas; extraction sets both to Ar\u2014ungrounded.\n- Supercycle design: The paper uses variable n1/n2/n3; extraction fixes counts to 1:1:1 without evidence; also mismatches the reported optimal composition range (XIn 0.56\u20130.63, XGa 0.13\u20130.17, XZn 0.17\u20130.34).\n- Crystallinity: Set to amorphous, but the article shows composition-dependent crystallinity; the optimal region lies in the \u201clight green\u201d zone with cubic-In2O3(222) features, not amorphous.\n- Material properties: Refractive index, absorption coefficient, resistivity, uniformity, conformality, and roughness are not reported in the paper; provided values are ungrounded.\n- Band gap: A single value (3.5 eV) is given, but the article reports composition-dependent Eg; no specific sample value is cited.\n- Film composition: \u2018elementalConcentration\u2019 is a single 58.5% value with no element specified; ambiguous and not traceable. The \u2018atomicRatio\u2019 0.56:0.13:0.17 cherry-picks one boundary of a range; not a specific reported sample.\n- Electrical properties (film): \u2018carrierDensity\u2019 is given as 1e17 m^-3, which is inconsistent with the article\u2019s threshold (>1e17 cm^-3 \u2248 >1e23 m^-3). \u2018mobility\u2019 43.7 cm^2/V\u00b7s is labeled as Hall mobility, but that value is device field-effect mobility; method is wrong.\n- Device properties: SS is reported as 0.25 mV; the article states 0.24\u20130.25 V/dec. Given schema\u2019s ElectricPotential in MilliV, the correct numeric value should be ~250 mV, not 0.25 mV. On/off ratio is not reported in the article; value given is ungrounded.\n\nProperties to correct/review: dosingTime units and values (use ms equivalents of reported seconds), remove or explicitly mark unreported purge/flow/GPC/number of cycles/saturation/nucleation/conformality/uniformity/roughness/resistivity values, correct crystallinity to reflect composition dependence (for the chosen composition), fix carrierDensity magnitude and method mapping, do not label device \u03bc_FE as Hall mobility, set SS to 250 mV if representing 0.25 V/dec, avoid asserting carrier/purge gas without source, and align supercycle counts with reported compositions or omit if not specified."

        "rationale": "Several key values are incorrect, untraceable, or schema-incoherent, and only a single process is provided despite multiple compositions being reported. Specific issues: (1) Many process parameters are invented/not reported in the article: growth-per-cycle (0.1 \u00c5 for all oxides), total cycles (100), saturation, nucleation period (5 cycles), co-reactant dose times (100 ms), purge times (10 ms), and all flow rates are not given in the paper. (2) Unit errors: precursor dosing times are given in seconds in the article (DADI=1.5 s, TMGa=0.1 s, DEZ=0.1 s) but encoded with MilliSEC units and second-level numeric values (should be 1500, 100, 100 ms). Subthreshold swing is reported as 0.24\u20130.25 V/dec but encoded as 0.25 mV (should be 250 mV if using MilliV). Carrier density is reported in cm^-3 (>1e17 cm^-3) but encoded as 1e17 m^-3 (off by 10^6). (3) Film composition inconsistencies: the atomicRatio value '0.56:0.13:0.17' does not sum to 1 and does not match the stated optimal region (XIn 0.56\u20130.63, XGa 0.13\u20130.17, XZn 0.17\u20130.34). ElementalConcentration is given as a single 58.5% value without per-element breakdown and is not traceable. (4) Crystallinity is set to amorphous, whereas the optimal-composition region discussed for high mobility shows cubic-In2O3 (light-green region) signatures by XRD/TEM. (5) Supercycle design is specified as 1:1:1 counts, which conflicts with the varied n1:n2:n3 used to reach different compositions; the actual subcycle counts for the reported sample are not provided. (6) Carrier/purging gases are assumed as Ar; the article only specifies Ar/O2 plasma as the oxidant and does not state a carrier or purge gas. (7) Additional properties such as refractive index, roughness, conformality aspect ratio, on/off ratio are not reported in the article but are filled with guessed values. Positives: PEALD method, precursors (DADI/TMGa/DEZ), temperature (200 \u00b0C), pressure (1.2 Torr \u2248 mmHg), plasma power (300 W), substrate types, film thickness (20 nm), device structure (staggered bottom-gate, top-contact) and device metrics (\u00b5_FE\u224843.7 cm^2/V\u00b7s, V_TH\u2248-1.0 V) align with the text. To improve completeness, correct units and values, provide a valid atomic ratio that sums to 1 with matching composition, set crystallinity consistent with the chosen sample, omit or mark as not reported the parameters not given (GPC, flows, purge/dose times for oxidant, roughness, refractive index, conformality, on/off), specify or omit carrier/purge gas if unspecified, avoid duplicating device mobility as film mobility, and either extract multiple processes for different compositions or clearly tie all values to one specific sample with its actual n1:n2:n3 supercycle counts."
