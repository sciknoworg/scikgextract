Additionally, some numerical values like 'growthPerCycle' and 'filmThickness' are missing. These omissions should be filled to fully comply with the schema and accurately represent the process described in the article."

        "rating": "4",
        "rationale": "The extracted data captures most of the required information from the article, including the use of PEALD, precursors, and key device properties like mobility and threshold voltage. However, several properties are missing or not properly filled, such as carrier gas, purging gas, delivery method, and reactor details. These omissions prevent the extraction from being fully complete and schema-compliant. The missing information should be added to ensure all required fields are present and accurately reflect the article's content."
