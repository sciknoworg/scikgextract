        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues. Examples: (1) Wrong precursors: the article explicitly uses triethylindium (TEIn), an In\u2013Ga bimetallic single precursor, and diethylzinc (DEZn) with O3 (Experimental Details), but the extraction lists DADI and omits TEIn. (2) Mis-labeled GPC: 0.67/0.44/0.65 \u00c5/cycle belong to TEIn/In\u2013Ga bimetallic/DEZn at 200 \u00b0C (SI Fig. S1), yet they are attached to a generic \u201cInGaZnO\u201d compound. (3) Incorrect composition ratio: atomicRatio \u201c1.0:2.8:5.4\u201d does not match Table 2 (A: 0.2:1.0:1.2; B: 0.7:1.0:1.8; C: 1.4:1.0:2.0). (4) Numerous nulls violate schema and the task requirement of no empty/null values: pressure.numericValue, plasmaPower.numericValue (not applicable for TALD), numberofCycles, nucleationPeriod, dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, many material/device properties. (5) Supercycle design incomplete: only 0:2:2 is shown without separate processes for A, B, C (Table 2), and the numberofSubcycles are tied to \u201cInGaZnO\u201d instead of TEIn/In\u2013Ga/DEZn. (6) Missing multiple ALD processes described in the paper: separate processes for Al2O3 GI (O3- and H2O-processed) and AZO GE by ALD at 180 \u00b0C are not extracted; only one IGZO process is provided despite the article covering several ALD steps. (7) Device properties left blank despite Table 3 reporting \u03bc_sat, SS, V_TH; also the single process cannot coherently represent multiple gate stacks. (8) Unsubstantiated entries: filmStability and reproducibility set to True without support; \u201csaturation: True\u201d is assumed, not evidenced. To correct: replace DADI with TEIn; map GPCs to the correct precursors; fix atomic ratios to Table 2; remove plasmaPower for TALD; avoid all null numericValues (omit optional fields or provide reported values); add distinct process instances for IGZO (A, B, C), Al2O3 (O3 and H2O oxidants), and AZO (180 \u00b0C); and populate device properties from Table 3 for the relevant stacks."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Major incompleteness and schema violations. (1) Multiple processes not extracted: the article reports three distinct ALD IGZO compositions with different subcycle ratios (TEIn:In-Ga:DEZn = 0:2:2, 1:2:2, 2:2:2; Films A, B, C) and device results for several gate-stack combinations; only one process object is provided. (2) Incorrect precursor: DADI is listed, but the article uses triethylindium (TEIn), an In\u2013Ga bimetallic single precursor, and DEZn with O3; TEIn is missing and DADI is not reported. (3) Numerous required numeric fields are null, violating the schema (e.g., pressure, numberofCycles, nucleationPeriod, dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, many material and device properties). The schema requires numbers, not nulls. (4) Supercycle design is incomplete: only one count set (0:2:2) appears; counts for 1:2:2 and 2:2:2 are missing; subcycleSequence is correct. (5) Growth-per-cycle values are given but the \u2018compound\u2019 is mislabeled as \u201cInGaZnO\u201d instead of mapping to the specific subcycles/precursors (TEIn, In\u2013Ga, DEZn). (6) Film composition/atomic ratio is incorrect and untraceable (\u201c1.0:2.8:5.4\u201d); the article provides XPS-derived values (e.g., A: 4.0:20.1:24.2 at.% and normalized 0.2:1.0:1.2; B and C similarly). (7) Device properties are left null despite Table 3 providing \u03bc_sat, SS, and V_TH for multiple device stacks; at least one coherent mapping per process should be included. (8) Plasma power is populated with null though the process is thermal ALD; it should be omitted instead of null. (9) Several optional material properties (uniformity, conformality, roughness, density, optical properties) are populated with nulls without support from the article. To improve completeness: add three separate ALD-IGZO process objects (A, B, C) with correct subcycle counts; correct the precursors (TEIn, In\u2013Ga bimetallic, DEZn) and co-reactant (O3); provide valid numeric entries or remove non-applicable fields; populate film composition from XPS (Table 2); include device metrics (\u03bc_sat, SS, V_TH) aligned to a chosen gate-stack per process; and avoid asserting unsupported items (e.g., filmStability)."
