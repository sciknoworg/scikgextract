        "rationale": "Several values are correct and traceable (PEALD method for InOx/GaOx/ZnOx; precursors DADI/TMGa/DEZ; O2 plasma co-reactant; tool name TFS200; deposition temperature 250 \u00b0C; plasma power 38 W; optimized 1:1:1 subcycle ratio; device Vth \u2248 \u22123.5 V and SS \u2248 230 mV/dec). However, many properties are unreported in the article, speculative, or incorrect: (1) thicknessControl.growthPerCycle uses 0.21 \u00c5 per compound; the article reports ~0.21 nm/cycle (i.e., ~2.1 \u00c5) for IGZO growth, likely per supercycle, not per single-oxide subcycle. (2) Reactor manufacturer \u201cTFS\u201d is not given; manufacturer is not stated. (3) Carrier/purging gases (Ar), deliveryMethod, reactor pressure (10 mTorr), saturation, nucleationPeriod, dosingTime, purgeTime, and all flowRates are not reported. (4) Supercycle subcycleSequence is not specified textually; only ratios are discussed. (5) Material properties (refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, mobility with Hall method, uniformity 5%, conformality aspect ratio 10, roughness 0.5 nm, density 5.5 g/cm\u00b3) are not provided. (6) Film composition values are incorrect/not traceable: atomicRatio \u201c1:1:1 (XPS)\u201d confuses deposition cycle ratio with measured composition; elemental concentration \u201810%\u2019 (single value) is unsupported. (7) Device onOffRatio (1e7) and fieldEffectMobility (10 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s) are not reported. (8) Possible schema compliance issue: filmThickness appears both inside growthPerCycle and again at thicknessControl level; ensure placement matches the schema\u2019s required location. Properties that should be corrected or reviewed: growthPerCycle value/unit and scope; reactor.manufacturer; all gases/pressures/times/flows; supercycle subcycleSequence; all material property and composition entries; device onOffRatio and mobility. Overall, many fields lack traceability to the article or are incorrect, leading to a low correctness score."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Large portions of the extraction are not traceable to the article and several numeric values are incorrect, so the process is not complete with respect to the source. Examples: (1) Many parameters are fabricated: carrier/purging gas (Ar), delivery method, reactor manufacturer, chamber pressure, dosing times, purge times, and all flow rates are not reported in the paper. (2) Thickness control is wrong: the article states GPC \u2248 0.21 nm/cycle, but the extraction uses 0.21 \u00c5/cycle (10\u00d7 too small) and assigns per\u2011compound GPCs that are not given; number of cycles (100) and film thickness (21 nm) are also not reported. (3) Material properties (refractive index, absorption, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, mobility, uniformity %, conformality aspect ratio, roughness, density) and film composition (XPS method, 1:1:1 atomic ratio) are not provided by the article; the 1:1:1 is a cycle ratio, not a measured atomic ratio. (4) Device on/off ratio (1e7) is inconsistent with reported Ion and Ioff; field\u2011effect mobility is not reported. (5) Substrate description and pressure are not specified in the article; the provided values are speculative. (6) Supercycle sequence order is not explicitly stated in text; providing a fixed sequence may be unfounded. Items correctly grounded include PEALD method, O2 plasma co\u2011reactant, precursors (DADI/TMGa/DEZ), deposition temperature (250 \u00b0C), plasma power (38 W), 1:1:1 cycle ratio, and device Vth/SS. To improve completeness and fidelity, restrict entries to those supported by the text (method, precursors, O2 plasma, 250 \u00b0C, 38 W, 1:1:1 ratio, Vth and SS), correct GPC to ~2.1 \u00c5/cycle if units must be \u00c5, remove or mark as not reported all dosing/purge/flow/pressure/film thickness/number of cycles/material-property/composition/safety/reproducibility values, and avoid asserting a subcycle sequence or substrate specifics unless explicitly stated."
