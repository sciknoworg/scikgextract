        "rationale": "The extraction has multiple schema violations, unsupported values, and inaccuracies relative to the article. Key issues: (1) Numerous numeric fields are null (None), violating the schema\u2019s number type and the no-empty-values rule: processParameters.pressure.quantityValue.numericValue, thicknessControl.growthPerCycle.values[].value.quantityValue.numericValue, thicknessControl.growthPerCycle.numberofCycles.quantityValue.numericValue, nucleationPeriod.quantityValue.numericValue, dosingTime/purgeTime/flowRates numericValues, supercycleDesign.numberofSubcycles[].count.quantityValue.numericValue, materialProperties.optical/electrical/uniformity/conformality/roughness/filmDensity numericValues, deviceProperties.onOffRatio.quantityValue.numericValue. (2) Optional objects are populated with invalid nulls instead of being omitted (e.g., processParameters.plasmaPower = None). (3) reactantSelection contains placeholders and an unsupported co-reactant: precursors listed as \u2018Not Found\u2019 (duplicated), carrierGas/purgingGas as \u2018Not Found\u2019, and coReactant set to O3 without support in the text; the paper does not report the oxidant or carrier/purge gases. (4) Substrate is incorrect: set to \u201cthermally grown SiO2/Si substrates,\u201d while the article describes devices fabricated on 300 mm wafers with an Al2O3/SiO2/SiN oxygen-tunnel stack; no thermally grown SiO2 substrate is stated. (5) Temperature is set to 200 \u00b0C without justification; the article only reports a deposition range of 200\u2013300 \u00b0C in a thermal ALD showerhead reactor, not a single value. (6) Supercycle design is not aligned with the article: subcycleSequence listed as [\"InGaZnO\"] instead of binary-oxide subcycles (e.g., In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO); counts are null though the text states 2\u20139 cycles per sub-cycle. (7) Film composition is incorrect/untraceable: atomicRatio \"1.0:2.8:5.4\" with method \"XPS depth profile\" is not in the article; compositions are given as metal fractions (e.g., In0.17Ga0.45Zn0.38) measured by XRF. (8) Crystallinity \"amorphous\" is asserted without citation; not explicitly reported. (9) Saturation=True is unsubstantiated. (10) Many fields use the literal string \u2018Not Found\u2019, which breaks the requirement for traceable, factual values. While some device metrics (\u03bc=8 cm2/V\u00b7s, VTH=0.3 V, SS=94 mV/dec) correctly match the best In-poor sample (In0.17Ga0.45Zn0.38), the overall record is largely non-compliant and not traceable. Properties to correct/review: reactantSelection (all), substrate, temperature (use reported range or omit if schema permits), pressure, thicknessControl (GPC, cycles), supercycleDesign (sequence and counts), filmComposition (use XRF-based metal fractions), crystallinity, all optical/electrical/uniformity/conformality/roughness/density values, onOffRatio, and remove null/placeholder entries."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Very incomplete and partially incorrect. (1) Multiple processes not captured: the article reports six distinct IGZO compositions (e.g., In0.05Ga0.45Zn0.50, In0.05Ga0.35Zn0.60, In0.10Ga0.45Zn0.45, In0.10Ga0.35Zn0.55, In0.17Ga0.45Zn0.38, In0.40Ga0.35Zn0.25), but only one process is extracted. Each composition corresponds to a different ALD supercycle design and should be a separate process. (2) Schema-required fields are populated with placeholders or nulls, violating the schema and the \u2018no empty/null\u2019 rule: reactantSelection (precursors, co-reactant, carrier/purging gas), processParameters.pressure, thicknessControl.growthPerCycle.values.value.quantityValue.numericValue, numberofCycles, nucleationPeriod, dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, and many materialProperties (uniformity, conformality, roughness, filmDensity) have numericValue = None or \u201cNot Found\u201d. (3) Ungrounded or incorrect values: coReactant = O3 is not stated in the paper; substrate set to \u201cthermally grown SiO2/Si\u201d conflicts with the reported multilayer OT stack on 300 mm Si wafers; temperature fixed at 200 \u00b0C whereas the article only states 200\u2013300 \u00b0C; supercycleDesign is missing the elemental subcycles (InOx, GaOx, ZnO) and counts despite SI noting 2\u20139 cycles per subcycle; filmComposition uses an XPS atomic ratio (1.0:2.8:5.4) not reported\u2014composition was verified by XRF and provided as metal fractions in Table 1. (4) Incoherence: deviceProperties (\u03bc=8 cm2/V\u00b7s, VTH=0.3 V, SS=94 mV/dec) match the In0.17Ga0.45Zn0.38 sample, but the process object does not specify this composition nor the corresponding supercycle counts, breaking traceability. (5) Non-compliant entries: plasmaPower is set to None even though TALD was used (should be omitted); many numeric fields contain None with QUDT units, violating numeric requirements. To improve: create separate processes for each composition; correct substrate; either omit or correctly populate plasmaPower; provide grounded co-reactant/precursor (or state unavailable and avoid placeholders if schema allows); add supercycle subcycleSequence with InOx/GaOx/ZnO and counts (a:b:c) per composition; use 7 nm film thickness; keep temperature as a range or leave unspecified if not allowed; populate or omit non-reported materialProperties rather than using nulls; align composition with Table 1 (XRF) and remove unsupported XPS ratio; fill pressure/dose/purge/flows only if reported, otherwise note missing per schema."
