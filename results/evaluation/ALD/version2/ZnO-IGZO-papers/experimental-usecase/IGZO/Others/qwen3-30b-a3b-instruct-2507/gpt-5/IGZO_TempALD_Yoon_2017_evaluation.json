        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues. Key problems: (1) Missing processes: the article reports three ALD temperatures (130, 150, 170 \u00b0C) with distinct properties; only one process (150 \u00b0C) is extracted. (2) Schema violations: 'plasmaPower' is set to null but must be an object or omitted; filmDensity uses unit GM-PER-DeciM3 (g/dm\u00b3) with value 5.9, which corresponds to 5.9 g/dm\u00b3 instead of the reported 5.9 g/cm\u00b3 (should be 5900 g/dm\u00b3 if that unit is used). (3) Incorrect or misinterpreted values: 'thresholdVoltage' = 0.6 V is actually the PBS \u0394Vth shift, not Vth; 'electricalProperties.mobility' is listed as 10.4 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s with four\u2011point probe as the method\u2014mobility was extracted from TFT transfer characteristics, while four\u2011point probe measured conductivity; 'deviceStructure' should be 'top-gate bottom-contact'. (4) Non-traceable/guessed parameters: reactor pressure (1 mTorr), growth-per-cycle (0.18 \u00c5), dosing/purge times, flow rates, 'saturation', 'nucleationPeriod', refractive index, absorption coefficient, resistivity, carrier density, uniformity (5%), conformality (aspect ratio 10), safety/reproducibility booleans\u2014none are reported in the article. (5) Supercycle design/specification: 'numberofSubcycles' = 1 for InGaOx and ZnO and 'subcycleSequence' are not given in the article; 'numberofCycles' = 120 refers to supercycles in the text, not total ALD cycles as used here. (6) Composition reporting: 'elementalConcentration' 33.3% is incorrect for the stated 1:1:3 ratio (would be ~20%, 20%, 60% if converted); 'crystallinity' method is set to XRD, but the article does not report XRD. (7) Carrier/purging gas: nitrogen is only stated as purge gas; listing it also as carrier gas is not supported by the text. Corrections needed: add separate processes for 130, 150, and 170 \u00b0C with traceable values (film thickness, band gap, roughness, mobility, on/off ratio); remove or leave unspecified any parameters not reported; omit 'plasmaPower' instead of null; fix filmDensity unit/value; remove misassigned 'thresholdVoltage' or replace with actual Vth if reported; align mobility and its method under deviceProperties; correct deviceStructure; omit speculative supercycle counts; revise composition reporting to match the 1:1:3 ratio and omit unsupported elemental %s."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Major incompleteness and schema issues. (1) Multiple processes missing: the article reports IGZO ALD at 130, 150, and 170 \u00b0C with distinct film thicknesses (21.4, 24.3, 27.4 nm), band gaps (3.81, 3.26, 3.21 eV), roughness (0.30, 0.34, 0.46 nm) and device mobilities (6.1, 10.4, 14.8 cm2/V\u00b7s). Only a single process (150 \u00b0C) is extracted, violating the requirement to represent each experiment. (2) Numerous values are ungrounded or incorrect: reactor pressure (1 mTorr), dosing/purge times, flow rates, growth-per-cycle, nucleation period, saturation, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, refractive index, absorption coefficient, film resistivity and carrier density are not reported in the article; thresholdVoltage = 0.6 V misuses the PBS shift (\u0394Vth = +0.6 V) as the absolute VTH; film mobility under materialProperties is not reported (device \u03bc is reported instead); crystallinity method \u201cXRD\u201d is not mentioned. (3) Schema violation: plasmaPower is set to null, but the schema expects an object if present. (4) Supercycle design specifics (number of subcycles and sequence) are not provided in the article; assigning counts and sequence is ungrounded, and the article\u2019s \u201c120 supercycles\u201d is conflated with total ALD cycles. To improve completeness, add three separate process entries (130/150/170 \u00b0C) with traceable values for film thickness, band gap, roughness, density, and device metrics; remove or mark as not reported any parameters not provided (pressure, dosing/purge/flows, GPC, nucleation, uniformity, conformality, resistivity, carrier density, refractive index, absorption); correct thresholdVoltage to omit or provide the actual value if reported; remove plasmaPower or provide a valid object only if PEALD is used; keep supercycle count and description only as supported by the text (\u2018120 supercycles; supercycle composed of In\u2013Ga\u2013O and Zn\u2013O\u2019)."
