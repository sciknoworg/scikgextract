        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect and not schema-compliant. Major issues: (1) Process parameters: temperature set to 350 \u00b0C by misusing \u201coverall thermal budget under 350 \u00b0C\u201d (not a deposition temperature); pressure set to 1e-5 mmHg by misusing the electrical measurement vacuum (not the ALD deposition pressure). Required process design details (dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, saturation, nucleationPeriod, thicknessControl/filmThickness) are missing or set to None, violating the schema and the no-null rule. Film thickness (10 nm IGZO channel stated in the article) is omitted. (2) Reactant selection: coReactant set to O2 for In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO without support in the text; carrierGas and purgingGas are \u201cNot Found\u201d placeholders. Precursors are \u201cNot Found.\u201d These placeholders violate the instruction of no empty/null values and lack traceability. (3) Supercycle design: absent, despite the article stating composition control by varying In cycle ratios. (4) Material properties: multiple zero or placeholder values without support (uniformity 0%, conformality aspect ratio 0, elemental concentration 0%, roughness 0 nm, film density 0), and atomicRatio \u201cNot Found.\u201d Crystallinity \u201camorphous\u201d is unsubstantiated by the text. (5) Device properties: mobility (16.9 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s), SS (61.7 mV/dec), and VTH (0.68 V) match the article, but onOffRatio is None, violating schema typing. (6) Other aspects: filmStability and reproducibility are None (should be booleans), and safety is a placeholder. (7) Additional schema issues: multiple fields explicitly set to None where the schema expects typed objects/booleans/strings. Corrections needed: remove all placeholders/None; do not infer deposition temperature/pressure from unrelated statements; add filmThickness = 10 nm; provide or omit (if not extractable) valid reactants and supercycle details with traceable evidence; restrict properties to those supported by the article (e.g., device metrics and substrate), and ensure all required fields are present with valid QUDT-compliant units."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Extraction is largely incomplete and includes non-traceable or incorrect values and null/placeholders, violating schema-driven completeness. Key issues: (1) Reactant selection missing/incorrect: precursors set to 'Not Found'; co-reactant assumed as O2 for all sub-cycles without article support; carrier and purge gases set to 'Not Found'. (2) Process parameters misassigned: deposition temperature set to 350 \u00b0C (article only states overall thermal budget <350 \u00b0C; ALD IGZO deposition temperature not given); pressure 1e\u22125 Torr taken from electrical measurement vacuum, not deposition pressure; reactor and deliveryMethod missing. (3) Thickness control and supercycle design absent: no dosing/purge times, flow rates, GPC, cycle counts, or saturation; film thickness (article states 10 nm IGZO) omitted; supercycleDesign (In:Ga:Zn subcycle ratio controlling composition) missing though explicitly described. (4) Material properties filled with non-traceable placeholders: uniformity 0%, conformality aspect ratio 0, elemental concentrations 0% with EDS, atomic ratio 'Not Found', roughness and density 0, crystallinity \u2018amorphous\u2019 not evidenced in text. (5) Device properties partly correct (\u03bc_FE=16.9 cm^2/V\u00b7s, V_TH=0.68 V, SS=61.7 mV/dec) but onOffRatio is null. (6) OtherAspects contain placeholders/null. (7) Multiple processes not captured: the article reports several IGZO channels (varying In ratio) and different gate stacks/post-treatments (devices A\u2013F); only a single process is extracted. Numerous null/'Not Found'/0.0 entries and misattributed values make the extraction non-compliant and not traceable."
