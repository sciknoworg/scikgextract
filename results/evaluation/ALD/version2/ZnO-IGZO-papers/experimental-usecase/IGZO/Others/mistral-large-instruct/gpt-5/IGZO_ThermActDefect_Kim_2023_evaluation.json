        "rationale": "Several key fields are incorrect, ungrounded, or mix up the IGZO ALD with the Al2O3 GI process, despite some major items being correct (PEALD method, precursors, 200 \u00b0C, ~1.2 Torr, 100 W plasma, 6:1:1 supercycle, TG-BC device metrics). Main issues: (1) Co-reactant: For IGZO sub-cycles the article states an O2 plasma (100 W) reactant, but the extraction uses O3 for In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO. Update coReactant for each sub-oxide to O2 plasma. (2) Dosing/purge times: The 0.1 s TMA dose, 25 s purge, 5 s O3 dose, 20 s purge reported are for Al2O3 GI, not IGZO. The extraction applies these to IGZO and moreover uses milliseconds units (0.1 ms, 5 ms, 25 ms, 20 ms), which are off by 10^3. Remove or correct these for IGZO (not reported) and avoid unit errors. (3) Growth per cycle, number of cycles, flow rates, saturation, nucleationPeriod: Values (e.g., 0.1 \u00c5 GPC, 100 cycles, 100 sccm flows) are not reported and appear fabricated. Remove or mark unknown. (4) Film thickness: 30 nm is used for the stacked-film IGZO (Figure 1) while the device IGZO is 8 nm. Clarify which process is being represented; avoid duplicating filmThickness and ensure traceability. (5) Material properties (IGZO): Refractive index 1.62 and film density 3.12 g/cm3 are Al2O3 GI values, not IGZO; absorption coefficient is not reported. Remove or correct. Band gap 2.8 eV is supported (SE) for as-deposited IGZO. (6) Electrical properties: Resistivity, carrier density, and Hall mobility are not reported for IGZO; \u201cHall measurements\u201d are not mentioned. Remove these; device mobility belongs only under deviceProperties. (7) Uniformity/conformality: Not reported; the 2% thickness variation and AR=1.0 are ungrounded. (8) Film composition: The cation composition is In0.52Ga0.18Zn0.30O by XRF. The extraction\u2019s atomic ratio \u20181.0:2.8:5.4\u2019 and a single 52% value are incorrect. Use elements [In, Ga, Zn] with ratio 0.52:0.18:0.30 (XRF), and if reporting percentages, include 52/18/30% appropriately. (9) On/off ratio: 1e6 is not reported; remove unless sourced. Overall, multiple values are not traceable to the article or conflict with it, and several unit errors occur. Correct/review: coReactant, dosing/purge times and units, growthPerCycle, numberofCycles, flowRates, filmThickness context, optical/electrical properties (RI, density, resistivity, carrier density), uniformity/conformality, filmComposition ratios, onOffRatio."

        "rationale": "Major gaps and numerous inaccuracies relative to the article and the schema. Key issues: (1) Missing process: the article describes two ALD processes (IGZO PEALD and Al2O3 GI ALD). Only the IGZO process is extracted; the Al2O3 ALD process (TMA/O3, 200\u2013400 \u00b0C, 350 mTorr, explicit cycle timings) is absent. (2) Wrong reactant for IGZO: the article uses O2 plasma (100 W) as the co-reactant for In2O3, Ga2O3, and ZnO sub-cycles; the extraction incorrectly lists O3. (3) Dosing/purge times: values given (0.1, 25, 5, 20) are from the Al2O3 GI ALD sequence and are in seconds; the extraction assigns them (in milliseconds) to IGZO sub-cycles without support. (4) Unsupported parameters: GPC (0.1 \u00c5), number of cycles (100), and flow rates (100 SCM/min) are not reported; uniformity (2%), conformality (AR=1), absorption coefficient, resistivity, and on/off ratio are also not provided by the article. (5) Film thickness ambiguity: the article reports 8 nm IGZO (devices) and 30 nm in stacked films; the extraction mixes contexts (30 nm) without clarifying the specific process instance. (6) Composition errors: atomic ratio \u20181:2.8:5.4\u2019 is incorrect and the elemental concentration is incomplete; the article reports In0.52 Ga0.18 Zn0.30 O by XRF. (7) Misattributed properties: refractive index (\u22481.62) and film density (3.12 g/cm3) refer to Al2O3, not IGZO; mobility listed under material properties with \u2018Hall measurements\u2019 is not supported (mobility is device-extracted). (8) Several fields are fabricated or not traceable to the text. Items that are correct include: PEALD for each oxide, precursors (DADI/TMGa/DEZ), plasma power (100 W), substrate, and the supercycle ratio (6:1:1), plus device metrics VTH\u22480.05 V, \u03bcFE\u224827.6 cm2/Vs, and SS\u224861 mV/dec for the 400 \u00b0C GI case. To improve, add a separate Al2O3 ALD process with its reported parameters; correct the IGZO co-reactant to O2 plasma; remove or revise unsupported GPC, cycle count, flow, uniformity/conformality, absorption, resistivity, and on/off ratio; disambiguate film thickness; fix composition to In0.52:Ga0.18:Zn0.30; and remove misattributed Al2O3 properties from the IGZO record."
