        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues throughout. Key problems: (1) Schema violation: processParameters.plasmaPower is set to null; if PEALD wasn\u2019t used it should be omitted, not null. (2) Wrong/incoherent process/material definition: materialDeposited is IGO, yet aldMethod/reactants/supercycle include ZnO and filmComposition.atomicRatio lists [In,Ga,Zn] = 1:1:1. IGO in this work is In\u2013Ga\u2013O only; the 1:1:1 ternary applies to IGZO, not the IGO process reported for the device data (main device uses IGO 4:1). (3) Supercycle design incorrect: subcycleSequence includes ZnO and counts are 1:1:1; the paper reports IGO cation ratios 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 7:1 (no Zn), with the highlighted device at 4:1. (4) Delivery method is wrong: set to \u201cDirect current (DC) sputtering,\u201d which the article used for ITO electrodes, not ALD delivery; should describe thermal ALD with O3/Ar. (5) Numerous parameters are fabricated/not traceable: growthPerCycle (0.1 \u00c5), numberofCycles (100), dosing/purge times (10 ms), nucleationPeriod (10 cycles), saturation (True), precursorFlow (20 sccm) are not given in the paper. (6) Flow rates misuse: article gives total O3/Ar = 100/100 sccm (200 sccm total) and Ar purge 100 sccm; the extraction spreads numbers per compound and uses the QUDT unit SCM-PER-MIN (standard cubic meter per minute), not sccm, leading to unit/scale inconsistency. (7) Reactor metadata: reactor.name is set to \u201cNexusbe Inc.\u201d (manufacturer); article describes a vertical flow-type ALD chamber by Nexusbe Inc. (8) Material properties are largely invented: refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, roughness, and film density are not reported. (9) Crystallinity is wrong: marked \u201camorphous,\u201d while the paper reports cubic/crystalline IGO with high c-axis-aligned crystallinity (XRD, GIWAXS, TEM). (10) Device properties: \u03bc_FE = 90.7 cm^2/V\u00b7s, Vth = 0.34 V, and SS \u2248 92.2 mV/dec are correct; however, on/off ratio (1e6) is not reported. (11) Substrate description is imprecise: article uses 100 nm thermally grown SiO2 on a poly-Si substrate; the extraction omits \u201cpoly-Si.\u201d Corrections needed: remove Zn-related entries for IGO; set IGO supercycle to reflect In:Ga = 4:1 (or specify the tested ratios), fix reactor metadata (name vs manufacturer), remove/leave unspecified any dosing/purge/GPC/cycle/flow values that are not in the article (or provide only the reported O3/Ar 100/100 sccm and Ar purge 100 sccm with correct sccm units), correct crystallinity to cubic/c-axis-aligned crystalline (XRD/GIWAXS/TEM), remove unreported material-property values, drop deliveryMethod = sputtering, and omit plasmaPower entirely."

        "rationale": "The extraction contains many non-traceable or incorrect values and misses key process distinctions. Major issues: (1) Process identity mismatch: materialDeposited is IGO, but ZnO is included throughout (aldMethod, precursors, flowRates, subcycleSequence). For IGO, only In2O3 and Ga2O3 subcycles should be present; ZnO applies to IGZO, which is a separate process described but not extracted. (2) SupercycleDesign is incomplete/incorrect: counts do not reflect the reported IGO cation ratios (1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 7:1), and ZnO should not be in IGO; a separate IGZO process should capture the 1:1:1 case. (3) DeliveryMethod is wrong: listed as DC sputtering, which refers to ITO electrodes, not ALD precursor delivery. (4) Numerous parameters are fabricated and not traceable to the article: growth per cycle, nucleation period, dosing/purge times, precursor flow rates (for metal precursors), refractive index, absorption, band gap, resistivity, carrier density (and Hall method), uniformity, conformality, roughness, and film density. (5) Crystallinity is incorrect: the article reports c-axis-aligned crystalline/cubic In2O3-rich IGO (especially 4:1), not amorphous. (6) Film composition is inconsistent: chemicalComposition is IGO, but atomicRatio lists elements ['In','Ga','Zn'] with value '1:1:1' (IGZO), contradicting IGO; elemental concentration via XPS is not reported. (7) Reactor details are partially wrong/insufficient: \u2018name\u2019 repeats the manufacturer and omits the vertical flow-type descriptor; O3/Ar total 200 sccm (100/100) and O3 concentration (270 g m^-3) are not correctly reflected. (8) Device properties: \u00b5_FE, Vth, and SS are correct; on/off ratio is not reported. (9) Multiple processes described in the paper (IGO and IGZO ALD; Al2O3 gate insulator ALD with O2 plasma) are not represented as separate processes. Properties to add/fix: split into at least two ALD processes (IGO and IGZO) with correct subcycle counts/sequence; remove ZnO from IGO; correct deliveryMethod; restrict parameters to those reported (temperature 250 \u00b0C, pressure 300 mTorr, O3/Ar = 100/100 sccm, Ar purge 100 sccm, precursors DBADMIn/TMGa/DEZ, co-reactant O3); correct crystallinity; omit or justify any dosing/purge/GPC/flow values with citations; align film composition to In:Ga ratios for IGO and In:Ga:Zn for IGZO; refine reactor description to vertical flow-type ALD chamber (Nexusbe Inc.)."
