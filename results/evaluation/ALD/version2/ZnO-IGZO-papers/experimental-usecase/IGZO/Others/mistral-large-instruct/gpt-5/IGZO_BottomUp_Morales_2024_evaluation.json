        "rationale": "Major factual and unit errors plus many untraceable, invented values. Key issues: (1) Pressure: set to 10 mmHg, whereas the article reports 10\u201320 Pa (InOx 10 Pa; GaOx/ZnOx 20 Pa). If using the schema\u2019s mmHg unit, this should be ~0.075\u20130.15 mmHg; using a single 10 mmHg is wrong by orders of magnitude. (2) Dosing/purge times: values are given in seconds from the paper but encoded with unit MilliSEC without converting (e.g., 0.04 s should be 40 ms; 5 s \u2192 5000 ms; 4 s \u2192 4000 ms; 1 s \u2192 1000 ms). The special 40 s purge after the last TMGa dose is also omitted. (3) NucleationPeriod: set to 22 cycles, but for the full PEALD supercycle no nucleation delay was observed; 22 cycles pertains to TALD ZnO on InOx, not to this PEALD process. (4) Flow rates: coReactantFlow = 150 sccm is incorrect\u2014150 sccm refers to N2 purge after O2 plasma, not O2 flow; O2 flow was not reported. Purge-flow handling is also conflated. (5) Co-reactant identity: should specify O2 plasma, not just O2, to reflect PEALD. (6) Number of cycles: set to 12 but that is the number of supercycles; total ALD cycles for PE(1/1/1) is 12\u00d7(3+3+2)=96. (7) Substrate text error: native oxide written as SiO instead of SiO2. (8) Film composition: atomicRatio given as 1:1:1, but XPS/EDX report ~1.0:1.0:1.1 (XPS) or 1.1:1.0:1.3 (EDX) for PE(1/1/1). ElementalConcentration \u20181%\u2019 is nonsensical. (9) Crystallinity: reported \u201camorphous\u201d, whereas the article describes \u201cnearly amorphous, nanocrystalline\u201d (broad XRD peak at 30\u201336\u00b0). (10) Optical/electrical/structural properties are largely fabricated and not traceable: refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, mobility, AFM roughness, film density (with an implausible unit), uniformity, conformality, and all TFT deviceProperties (\u03bcFE, VTH, SS, on/off, device structure) are not reported in the paper (only MIS J\u2013E/C\u2013V data were provided). Corrections needed: fix pressure value/unit; convert all timing values to ms; set nucleationPeriod to 0 for PEALD or specify per subcycle as applicable; correct coReactant to O2 plasma; correct flowRates (do not use 150 sccm as O2 flow); set numberofCycles to 96 for the 3/3/2\u00d712 supercycles; fix substrate to SiO2; update atomic ratio to reported XPS/EDX; revise crystallinity to \u201cnearly amorphous, nanocrystalline\u201d; remove or mark as not reported all optical/electrical/device/AFM/XRR parameters that the article does not provide."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Major incompleteness and inconsistencies. (1) Multiple processes are reported in the article but only one process is extracted. The paper details at least five IGZO supercycle recipes: four full-PEALD compositions [PE(1/1/1), PE(1/1/2), PE(2/1/1), PE(1/2/1)] and a mixed PEALD/TALD sample T(1/1/1) with different subcycle counts and, for the TALD case, different chemistry (H2O). Each should be a separate process object with its specific subcycle counts (Table 2) and thickness (7\u20139 nm for PEALD, ~11 nm for T(1/1/1)). (2) Several values are not traceable or incorrect: nucleationPeriod is set to 22 cycles (applies to TALD-ZnO on InOx) while full PEALD shows no nucleation delay; TALD-ZnO on GaOx shows ~13 cycles. Pressure is given as 10 mmHg, whereas the article specifies P_t per subcycle in Pa (10, 20, 20 Pa); the unit/values are wrong and not per compound. Dosing/purge times use the unit MilliSEC but the numeric values are in seconds (e.g., 0.04 s, 5 s); also the special 40 s purge after the last TMGa dose is omitted. Flow rates: 150 sccm is N2 purge after O2 plasma, not O2 co-reactant flow; O2 flow is not specified in the article. (3) ThicknessControl.numberofCycles is set to 12 (supercycles), but schema implies total ALD cycles; for PE(1/1/1) it should be 96 (12\u00d7(3+3+2)) if interpreted as cycles. (4) Material/device properties are largely fabricated and not supported by the article: refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, roughness (AFM), film density (XRR), uniformity, conformality, and TFT device metrics (mobility, Vth, SS, on/off) are not reported. The article provides MIS J\u2013E and C\u2013V, not Hall/TFT data. (5) Film composition is misreported: atomic ratio is set to 1:1:1, while XPS/EDX give, e.g., ~1.0:1.0:1.1 for PE(1/1/1) (Table 2). (6) Crystallinity should be described as nearly amorphous/nanocrystalline (GIXRD), not purely amorphous. (7) Minor text error: substrate listed as SiO instead of SiO2. To improve, add separate processes for all reported recipes (with correct subcycle counts and TALD ZnO details), correct units/values (seconds vs milliseconds; Pa vs mmHg), map number of cycles appropriately, report XPS/EDX ratios from Table 2, reflect GIXRD phase properly, and remove or leave unspecified properties not supported by the article."
