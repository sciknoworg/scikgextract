        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect, mixes processes, and violates the schema. Specific issues: (1) Material/process mismatch: aldSystem.materialDeposited is IGZO and supercycle uses only InGaOx and ZnO, but deviceProperties (\u03bcFE=103.66, SS=96 mV/dec, Vth sign) are from the IGO (In:Ga=4:1) channel FET postannealed at 800 \u00b0C, not IGZO. (2) Supercycle design incorrect: Article states IGZO fabricated by ALD supercycle with In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO in 1:1:1; extraction collapses In+Ga into \u201cInGaOx\u201d and omits a Ga subcycle. (3) Precursors wrong: Indium precursor used in the article is (N,N\u2032-di-tert-butylacetamidinato)dimethylindium (amidinate), not DADI; gallium precursor (TMGa) is missing for any Ga subcycle; DEZ for Zn is correct. (4) Co-reactant/carrier/purge gas: O3 and Ar are correct, but reported ozone concentration (300 g m\u22123) and Ar 100 sccm purge are not reflected; many dosing/flow values are fabricated. (5) Deposition conditions: Temperature set to 200 \u00b0C is not grounded (optimized IGO deposited at 250 \u00b0C; IGZO deposition temperature not specified); substrate given as thermally grown SiO2/Si is not stated (devices used p++-Si with ONO). Pressure is misrepresented: article states 300 mTorr; extraction uses unit mmHg with numeric 300, which equals 300 mmHg (\u2248300 Torr), off by 10^3; it should be 0.3 mmHg if using mmHg. (6) Thickness control: GPC=0.1 \u00c5 and 100 cycles are not reported and contradict the 10 nm film; moreover filmThickness is incorrectly nested inside growthPerCycle (schema violation) and also duplicated at processParameters level. (7) Schema violations: plasmaPower is set to None (invalid type; optional field should be omitted); growthPerCycle includes an extra property filmThickness not allowed by the schema\u2019s additionalProperties:false; several quantities (flowRates as SCM-PER-MIN) are ungrounded. (8) Material properties mostly untraceable or incorrect: crystallinity set to polycrystalline for IGZO whereas the article reports ALD-IGZO (this work) as amorphous; optical properties, density, roughness, uniformity, conformality, resistivity, carrier density are not reported and appear fabricated; filmDensity unit/value (5.6 g/dm^3) is nonstandard. (9) Device properties: Vth sign is wrong (should be about \u22120.94 V for the IGO FET); on/off ratio value corresponds to IGO FET and is inconsistent with an IGZO process. (10) Supercycle and compounds inconsistent with the article\u2019s IGZO definition. Many values are not traceable to the text and multiple schema constraints are violated. Properties to correct/review: materialDeposited, supercycleDesign (include separate In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO subcycles with correct counts), precursors per element, deposition temperature and pressure (with correct units/values), substrate, remove/justify dosing/purge/flow values, fix plasmaPower typing or omit, fix growthPerCycle structure, align material and device properties (including Vth sign) with the selected process or remove unreported values."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect and not traceable to the article, with multiple schema and factual issues. Key problems: (1) Wrong process/material focus: The study\u2019s main ALD film used in devices is IGO (In:Ga=4:1) deposited at 250 \u00b0C and postannealed at 800 \u00b0C, whereas the JSON sets materialDeposited to IGZO and mixes inapplicable subcycles (uses \u201cInGaOx\u201d + ZnO instead of separate In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO) and device metrics from IGO FETs. (2) Precursors are incorrect/incomplete: The article uses (N,N\u2032-ditert-butylacetimidamido)-dimethylindium for In, trimethylgallium for Ga, and diethylzinc for Zn with O3; the JSON lists DADI for \u201cInGaOx,\u201d omits Ga\u2019s precursor, and collapses In and Ga into one \u201ccompound.\u201d (3) Supercycle design is wrong/missing: For IGZO, the article states In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1; for IGO, In:Ga ratios (1:1 to 7:1, optimized at 4:1). The JSON provides only \u201cInGaOx\u201d and ZnO with count=1 and no valid a:b:c or In:Ga ratios. (4) Process parameters are not aligned/traceable: Deposition temperature is set to 200 \u00b0C (article selects 250 \u00b0C); substrate is listed as \u201cthermally grown SiO2/Si,\u201d while devices are fabricated on p++ Si with ONO; O3 concentration (300 g/m^3) and Ar purge flow (100 sccm) reported in the article are not captured correctly (precursor/co-reactant flow rates are invented). Many fields (GPC, number of cycles, dosing/purge times, nucleation period) are populated with unreported values (e.g., 1 ms dosing/purge), lacking traceability. (5) Material properties are largely fabricated: refractive index, roughness, density (unit choice GM-PER-DeciM3 yields unrealistic magnitude), Hall mobility (10 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s) and resistivity/carrier density values do not match the reported IGO Hall data trends and units (article reports \u03a9\u00b7cm and cm\u207b\u00b3). (6) Device properties mix contexts: the \u03bc_FE=103.66 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s, Vth\u22480.94 V, SS\u224896 mV/dec match IGO-channel FETs after 800 \u00b0C anneal, not an IGZO process as labeled. (7) Schema issues: plasmaPower is set to null (must be omitted or provided as a valid object); processParameters requires a top-level filmThickness (per schema) which is missing; several entries (e.g., arbitrary dosing/purge times) violate traceability. Missing/should be added or corrected: separate processes for IGO (In:Ga=4:1 at 250 \u00b0C, O3 co-reactant, Ar purge 100 sccm, 300 mTorr) and any IGZO comparison if actually detailed; correct per-oxide subcycles and ratios; correct precursors (In amidinate, TMGa, DEZ) and O3; accurately report only parameters present in the article (remove invented GPC, times, flows) and align substrate and device context. Overall, the extraction is incomplete, inconsistent with the article, and not schema-compliant."
