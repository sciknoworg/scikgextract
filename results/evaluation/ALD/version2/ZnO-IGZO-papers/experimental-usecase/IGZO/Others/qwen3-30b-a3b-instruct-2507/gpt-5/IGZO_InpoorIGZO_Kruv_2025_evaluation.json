        "rationale": "Major portions of the extraction are not traceable to the article and several fields violate the schema. Key issues: (1) Unsubstantiated chemistry and gases: listed precursors (DADI, TMGa, DEZ), co-reactant (O3), carrier/purging gases (Ar/N2), dosing/purge times, flow rates, reactor pressure, and delivery details are not reported in the paper or SI. (2) Temperature/pressure: 250 \u00b0C is arbitrarily chosen within a 200\u2013300 \u00b0C range; reactor pressure (0.1 mTorr) is not given. (3) Schema violations: plasmaPower is set to null (must be a typed object or omitted); thicknessControl nests numberofCycles and filmThickness inside growthPerCycle (not allowed) and also duplicates filmThickness; required thicknessControl \u2018values\u2019 at the correct level are not provided; supercycleDesign includes a subcycle count of 1, contradicting SI stating a minimum of 2 cycles per sub-cycle for the recipe. (4) Fabricated material properties: refractive index, absorption/band gap, roughness, density, uniformity, conformality, and \u2018Hall measurements\u2019 electrical properties are not reported. (5) Film composition: elementalConcentration is given as a single 17% value (ambiguous/incomplete) and chemicalComposition \u2018In0.17Ga0.45Zn0.38O\u2019 is not stated by authors (oxygen stoichiometry not provided). (6) Reactor manufacturer set to \u2018imec\u2019 (not a manufacturer). (7) Device properties: \u03bcFE = 8 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1, VTH = 0.3 V, SS = 94 mV/dec match the text for In0.17Ga0.45Zn0.38, but the on/off ratio (10^6) is not reported. (8) Process multiplicity: multiple IGZO compositions are described, but only one process instance is provided. Properties that should be corrected/reviewed: reactantSelection (precursors, co-reactant, gases), all dosing/purge/flow/pressure values, temperature, plasmaPower, thicknessControl structure and values, supercycleDesign counts, optical/electrical/roughness/density/uniformity/conformality data, film composition representation, reactor manufacturer, onOffRatio, and inclusion of separate processes if justified by the article."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Largely incomplete and weakly grounded. The article reports ALD-IGZO channels with six distinct compositions and a 7 nm film deposited in a thermal ALD showerhead reactor, but the extraction presents a single process instance and invents many parameters. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes missing: the paper studies at least six IGZO compositions (Table 1); each distinct ALD recipe/supercycle should be represented, but only one process is provided. (2) Non-traceable precursors/co-reactant and gases: DADI/TMGa/DEZ and O3, carrier gas Ar, and purging gas N2 are not specified in the article/SI; they appear fabricated. (3) Fabricated process parameters: reactor pressure, dosing/purge times, flow rates, nucleation period, saturation, growth-per-cycle values, and number of cycles (set to 7, inconsistent with 7 nm thickness and sub-\u00c5 GPC) are not reported and conflict with plausible ALD counts. (4) Schema violations/invalid entries: plasmaPower set to null (should be omitted or a valid object); chemicalComposition \"In0.17Ga0.45Zn0.38O\" violates the schema pattern (decimals and uncertain O stoichiometry); elementalConcentration given as a single 17% value is incomplete (Ga and Zn concentrations missing) and unclear. (5) Supercycle design not grounded: counts 1:2:3 and sequence are not reported; SI only states 2\u20139 subcycles per component without exact ratios. (6) Material properties mostly invented: refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap (Tauc), resistivity, carrier density, Hall mobility/method, uniformity, conformality, roughness (AFM), and film density are not reported; film density unit/value is also unrealistic. (7) Device properties partly correct but incomplete: \u03bc=8 cm2/Vs, VTH=0.3 V, SS=94 mV/dec match the In0.17Ga0.45Zn0.38 sample, but on/off ratio is not given in the paper; ION and RC (reported) are not represented (schema lacks these fields). (8) Traceability gaps: manufacturer set as 'imec' (not stated as reactor manufacturer), temperature fixed at 250 \u00b0C (article states 200\u2013300 \u00b0C range). To improve completeness, add a separate process for each IGZO composition with verifiable supercycle design (a:b:c), include only parameters explicitly reported (film thickness 7 nm; thermal ALD; 200\u2013300 \u00b0C range or leave unspecified), remove nulls and fabricated values, correct chemicalComposition (e.g., In-Ga-Zn-O or leave to atomicRatio), and confine device properties to those reported."
