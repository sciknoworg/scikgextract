        "rationale": "Largely incorrect and not traceable to the article; several schema issues. Key problems: (1) ALD method/oxidant mismatch: the article describes IGZO ALD using three subcycles (In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO) and compares O2 plasma vs O3 oxidants (and later states O2 is chosen to avoid H influence). The extraction sets method to TALD, provides a plasma power (implying PEALD), and chooses only O3 as co-reactant\u2014contradictory to the text. (2) Supercycle design mis-modeled: should list subcycles and counts for In2O3, Ga2O3, and ZnO with a:b:c ratios; instead it uses a single \u201cInGaZnO\u201d entry and sequence, which is semantically wrong relative to the article. (3) Fabricated/unsupported parameters: reactor (Picosun R200), temperature (200 \u00b0C), pressure (10 mTorr), dosing/purge times, flow rates, nucleation period, growth-per-cycle, number of cycles, saturation, and film thickness values are not reported in the article. (4) Internal inconsistency and schema violation: growthPerCycle value (0.1 \u00c5) cannot yield 20 nm from 200 cycles; numberofCycles and filmThickness are incorrectly nested inside growthPerCycle (schema requires numberofCycles as a sibling under thicknessControl). FilmThickness is also duplicated outside thicknessControl. (5) ReactantSelection: \u201cIn-Ga bimetallic precursor\u201d and \u201cDiethylzinc (DEZn)\u201d are not stated in the article; the article only notes three (unspecified) precursors for In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO. (6) Device properties and structure: mobility, VTH, SS, on/off ratio, and \u201cbottom-gate top-contact\u201d are not supported; the article uses vertical, gate-all-around IGZO TFTs. (7) Material properties and composition: refractive index, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, roughness, density, uniformity, and an atomic ratio \u20181.0:2.8:5.4\u2019 with XPS depth profiling are not provided; the article only shows uniform elemental mapping (EDS). (8) Multiple processes missing: the article compares O2 plasma vs O3 and different cycle ratios; only one process is provided. Properties to correct/review: aldSystem.aldMethod (should reflect PEALD if using O2 plasma), reactantSelection.coReactant (O2 plasma and/or O3 as used), supercycleDesign (list In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO with a:b:c counts and sequence), remove or justify all numerical parameters (reactor, T, P, times, flows, GPC, cycles, thickness), fix thicknessControl schema (place numberofCycles correctly), and remove unsupported device/material metrics or replace with values traceable to the article. Overall, the extraction is not aligned with the source and violates schema semantics."

        "rationale": "Largely incorrect and non-traceable to the article. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes not captured: the article compares IGZO ALD using O2 vs O2 plasma oxidants (implying TALD and PEALD variants), but only one process is provided and labeled TALD; no separate process instance for the PEALD case. (2) Reactants wrong/missing: co-reactant is set to O3, whereas the article states O2 or O2 plasma. Precursors are given as an \u201cIn\u2013Ga bimetallic precursor\u201d and DEZn for a single \u2018InGaZnO\u2019 compound; the article describes three distinct sub-cycles with separate precursors for In2O3, Ga2O3, and ZnO (no bimetallic precursor is reported). (3) Supercycle design incorrectly modeled: the article specifies supercycles composed of In2O3, Ga2O3, and ZnO with an adjustable cycle ratio [x:y:z]; the extraction lists only one compound \u2018InGaZnO\u2019 in subcycleSequence/numberofSubcycles and omits the per-oxide counts and sequence. (4) Process parameters ungrounded: reactor (Picosun R200), plasma power (100 W), temperature (200 \u00b0C), pressure, dosing/purge times, flow rates, GPC, nucleation period, and film thickness values are not reported in the article text; they appear fabricated. (5) Material properties ungrounded: refractive index, absorption, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, mobility, uniformity, conformality aspect ratio, roughness, density, and composition ratio are not provided in the article (only qualitative EDS elemental mapping is shown); the atomic ratio \u20181.0:2.8:5.4\u2019 and XPS method are unsupported. (6) Device properties inconsistent: numerical values (\u03bcFE, VTH, SS, on/off) and a \u2018bottom-gate top-contact\u2019 structure do not match the vertical channel all-around IGZO FET architecture discussed and are not given numerically. (7) Substrate mischaracterized: \u2018Thermally grown SiO2/Si substrates\u2019 does not reflect the etched vertical MIM stack context shown. To be complete and schema-compliant, add separate processes for O2 (TALD) and O2 plasma (PEALD); provide per-compound (In2Ox, Ga2Ox, ZnO) precursors and co-reactants; supply the supercycle subcycleSequence and counts [x:y:z] and total number of supercycles; correct oxidant(s); and only include parameters/film and device metrics actually reported (e.g., any labeled layer thicknesses in TEM). Review/remove all unsubstantiated reactor details, times, flows, GPC, and electrical/optical properties."
