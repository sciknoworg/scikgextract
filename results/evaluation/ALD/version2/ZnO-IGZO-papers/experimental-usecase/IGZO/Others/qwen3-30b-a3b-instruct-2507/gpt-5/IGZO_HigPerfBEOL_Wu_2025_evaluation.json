        "rationale": "Large portions of the extraction are ungrounded in the article and several entries violate schema or internal coherence. Specific issues: (1) Invented process details not reported anywhere in the paper: ALD method = TALD, reactor (Picosun R200), precursors (\u201cIn-Ga bimetallic precursor\u201d), co-reactant (O3), carrier/purging gases (Ar/N2), delivery method, deposition temperature (200 \u00b0C), pressure (10 mTorr), dosing/purge times (100 ms), flow rates, saturation, nucleation period, supercycle design, optical properties (n, absorption, band gap), film uniformity/conformality, elemental concentrations and atomic ratios, crystallinity by XRD, roughness by AFM, film density by XRR, and safety/reproducibility; none of these are traceable to the provided text. (2) Schema/compliance problems: plasmaPower is set to null but the schema expects an object if present; it should be omitted or provided with valid quantityValue/unit. Substrate is incorrectly set to \u201c6 nm-thick IGZO channel layer\u201d (this is the deposited film, not the substrate), violating semantic correctness. (3) Numerical inconsistency: growth-per-cycle of 0.1 \u00c5 with 60 cycles yields ~0.6 nm, which conflicts with the reported 6 nm film thickness; also filmThickness is redundantly specified and inconsistent with the GPC\u00d7cycles. (4) IGZO ALD supercycle is modeled as a single InGaZnO subcycle; the article provides no supercycle/composition details, so this is unsubstantiated and inconsistent with the IGZO ALD description in the task context (In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO sub-cycles). (5) While some device metrics are correct and traceable (\u03bcFE \u2248 45 cm2/V\u00b7s, on/off \u2248 1e11, Vth \u2248 1.1 V, SS \u2248 67.8 mV/dec, top-gate), the majority of the process and material properties are unsupported or incorrect. Properties needing correction/review: aldSystem.aldMethod, all reactantSelection fields, processParameters (reactor, substrate, temperature, pressure, dosing/purge/flow, thicknessControl, supercycleDesign), most materialProperties, and otherAspects; plasmaPower should be removed or properly populated; thicknessControl values must be made consistent with the 6 nm film thickness and supported by the article if retained."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely ungrounded and incomplete relative to the article and the schema. Major issues: (1) Many ALD parameters are fabricated and not traceable to the text: reactor (Picosun R200), ALD method (TALD), temperature (200 \u00b0C), pressure (10 mTorr), precursor (\u201cIn-Ga bimetallic precursor\u201d), co-reactant (O3), carrier/purging gases, dosing/purge times, flow rates, growth-per-cycle, nucleation period, uniformity, conformality, optical/electrical film properties, film composition, roughness, and density\u2014all absent from the article. (2) IGZO ALD supercycle details (a:b:c subcycle counts for In2O3:Ga2O3:ZnO, individual precursors such as DEZ/TMGa/indium precursor) are not reported; the extracted \u201csingle InGaZnO subcycle\u201d is scientifically inconsistent with IGZO ALD as described in the schema and not supported by the text. (3) A second ALD process (5 nm HfLaO gate dielectric) described in the article is not extracted as a separate process, violating the multi-process requirement. (4) Several schema/coherence problems: plasmaPower is set to null (type violation), substrate is incorrectly given as \u201c6 nm-thick IGZO channel layer\u201d (that is the film, not a substrate), and thicknessControl fields are mis-nested. (5) Device data partially align (\u03bc_FE \u2248 45 cm^2/V\u00b7s, on/off ~1e11, top-gate), but threshold voltage and SS values appear sourced from different supporting info and are not clearly tied to this device. To improve, remove unsubstantiated values and add: a separate HfLaO ALD process; verified ALD method, precursors and oxidants per element, supercycle a:b:c, dosing/purge/flows, temperature/pressure, substrate, and any film property metrics only if reported."
