    "correctness": {
        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Bad overall due to multiple schema violations, placeholders/nulls, unit errors, and incomplete process coverage, despite some correct, traceable details. Specific issues: (1) Multiple processes not extracted: article reports three ALD supercycles (TEIn:In-Ga:DEZn = 0:2:2, 1:2:2, 2:2:2) with distinct compositions and device metrics (Tables 1\u20132, 4). Only one process (Comp. A, 0:2:2) is represented; Comp. B and Comp. C processes are missing. (2) Schema violations and nulls: many required numeric fields are null, e.g., processParameters.pressure.quantityValue.numericValue, thicknessControl.growthPerCycle.values[].value.quantityValue.numericValue, growthPerCycle.numberofCycles.numericValue, dosingTime/ purgeTime/ flowRates numeric values, nucleationPeriod.numericValue, conformality.aspectRatio.numericValue, roughness.value.numericValue, filmDensity.value.numericValue, deviceProperties.onOffRatio.numericValue. plasmaPower is set to null but the schema expects an object if present. The instructions prohibit empty/null values. (3) Placeholders: 'Not Found' used for carrierGas, purgingGas, reactor.name/manufacturer, safety, etc., which violates the requirement to avoid empty/placeholder values. (4) Unit error: subthresholdSwing reported as 0.21 with unit MilliV; article gives 0.21 V/dec (Table 2). To comply with the schema\u2019s MilliV unit, it should be 210 mV, not 0.21 mV. (5) Mis-mapped properties: materialProperties.electricalProperties.mobility (16.1 cm2/Vs) is a device-level \u03bc_FE, not an intrinsic film mobility (schema provides deviceProperties for \u03bc_FE). (6) Uniformity misinterpretation: uniformity.variation set to 10% citing device-to-device/run-to-run parameter variation, not film thickness uniformity (schema intent). (7) Film composition incomplete: elementalConcentration provides a single 5% value (In at%), omitting Ga, Zn, O; atomicRatio is correct (1.0:2.8:5.4) but elemental concentrations should reflect all elements measured by XPS (Table 1). (8) Unsupported/assumed values: saturation set True without explicit statement; crystallinity set to amorphous without direct evidence in the provided text; pressure unspecified but present with null. (9) SupercycleDesign only lists subcycleSequence ['GaOx','ZnO'] and count 0:2:2 (correct for Comp. A) but lacks corresponding processes for 1:2:2 and 2:2:2. Corrections needed: extract three coherent processes (A, B, C) with supercycle counts 0/1/2 for InOx and 2/2 for GaOx and ZnO; populate deviceProperties for each (\u03bc_FE, SS, V_TH) from Table 2; fix SS units to mV (e.g., 210 mV for 0.21 V/dec); remove optional fields rather than setting null; provide only values traceable to the article (omit carrier/purge gas if not reported or confirm from text); align electricalProperties to film-level data (leave blank/omit if not measured); correct uniformity to film-thickness data (or omit if not reported); provide full elemental concentrations for In, Ga, Zn, O from Table 1."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Major incompleteness and multiple schema violations. (1) Missing processes: the article reports three distinct IGZO ALD compositions/supercycles (Comp. A 0:2:2, Comp. B 1:2:2, Comp. C 2:2:2), but only one process (Comp. A) was extracted. Each composition should be a separate process with its own supercycle design, film composition, and device metrics. (2) Numerous required fields are null or placeholders, violating the schema and the no-null rule: processParameters.pressure, thicknessControl.growthPerCycle.values[].value.numericValue, thicknessControl.numberofCycles, nucleationPeriod, dosingTime[].precursor/coReactant, purgeTime[].precursor/coReactant, flowRates[].precursorFlow/coReactantFlow/purgingGasFlow, conformality.aspectRatio, roughness.value, filmDensity.value, deviceProperties.onOffRatio; aldSystem.reactor.name/manufacturer, reactantSelection.carrierGas and purgingGas, deliveryMethod all set to 'Not Found' or None. (3) Unit/type inconsistencies: subthresholdSwing is given as 0.21 mV but the article reports 0.21 V/dec (\u2248210 mV/dec); plasmaPower is present as null despite TALD (it should be omitted). (4) Film composition is incomplete/misrepresented: elementalConcentration shows a single 5% value (appears to be In only) instead of the full XPS at.% set for Comp. A (In 5, Ga 14, Zn 27, O 54) and analogous values for B and C; uniformity 10% is taken from device-to-device variability, not film thickness uniformity. (5) Supercycle information is incomplete: only Comp. A\u2019s 0:2:2 is encoded; Comp. B and C subcycle counts and sequences are missing. (6) Traceability gaps: multiple fields are filled with placeholders rather than grounded values from the text/SI. To be complete, add separate process instances for Comp. A, B, and C; populate supercycleDesign (0:2:2, 1:2:2, 2:2:2 with appropriate subcycleSequence), correct device metrics and units, include full XPS composition for each, and either supply or omit (do not null) required parameters with QUDT-compliant units; remove placeholder strings and nulls."
