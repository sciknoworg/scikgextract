        "rationale": "Several core fields are correct and traceable (PEALD method per oxide, precursors DADI/TMGa/DEZ, carrier/purging gas Ar, temperature 200 \u00b0C, plasma power 100 W, pressure 1.2 Torr, supercycle ratio [In2O3\u00d718\u2013Ga2O3\u00d71\u2013ZnO\u00d71], sequence In2O3\u2192Ga2O3\u2192ZnO, device structure TG-BC, and device metrics for the O2 reference: \u03bcFE 135.8 cm2/V\u00b7s, VTH \u22121.41 V, SS 72.3 mV/dec). However, the extraction contains multiple schema violations, fabricated or untraceable values, and misses multiple processes described in the article: 1) Schema/unit violations: pressure unit uses Torr but schema allows only MilliM_HG; dosingTime/purgeTime units must be MilliSEC (ms) but SEC is used; growthPerCycle unit must be ANGSTROM but NanoM is used; absorptionCoefficient unit uses PER-CENTI-M while schema restricts UNITLESS. 2) Untraceable/fabricated data: growth-per-cycle values for In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO, numberofCycles=18, flowRates (sccm) for precursor/co-reactant/purge, saturation=True, nucleationPeriod=5 cycles, optical properties (n, absorption coefficient, band gap), film-level electrical properties (resistivity, carrier density, mobility), uniformity/conformality, roughness value, film density, on/off ratio. These are not reported in the article. 3) Composition errors: elementalConcentration set to a single 70% is non-informative; atomicRatio labelled as XPS but composition is reported by ED-XRF (Table S3: In 71.2 at.%, Ga 7.8 at.%, Zn 21.0 at.%). Atomic ratio should be derived from XRF and reported consistently. 4) Process coverage: the article reports multiple IGZO processes (O2-only and three selective N2O splits for In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO); only one process instance is extracted, failing to represent distinct processes. 5) Minor traceability issues: co-reactant times omit the N2O 5 s case and the 10 s reactant-stabilize step; substrate description could be clarified (IGZO on 100 nm SiO2/Si). Corrections needed: fix all unit enums to comply with schema (mmHg, ms, \u00c5, UNITLESS where required); remove or justify all values not in the article (or leave fields out if optional); replace composition with ED-XRF values and correct method; add separate process objects for each selective N2O split with the corresponding plasma exposure times; ensure all remaining values are directly traceable to the source text."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Major gaps and schema violations, with many non-traceable or incorrect values, and missing processes. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes not represented: the article reports at least four IGZO ALD variants (reference O2 plasma; full IGZO with N2O plasma 1 s and 5 s; and three selective N2O splits on In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO). Only one process is extracted, losing the selective supercycle/reactant conditions that control properties. (2) Schema/unit violations: pressure unit uses Torr instead of the schema-required MilliM_HG; dosing and purge time units use SEC instead of required MilliSEC; growth-per-cycle units use NanoM instead of ANGSTROM; absorption coefficient unit not allowed (PER-CENTI-M where schema expects UNITLESS). (3) Untraceable or fabricated parameters: flow rates (sccm) are not reported in the paper but are filled with numbers; growth-per-cycle values and nucleation period are not given; \u201csaturation\u201d marked true without evidence; uniformity, conformality, refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap (for IGZO), resistivity, carrier density, roughness, and film density are not reported for IGZO but populated. (4) Incomplete/incorrect timing of co-reactant: the article specifies O2 plasma exposure 1 s and N2O plasma exposure 1 or 5 s with a 10 s reactant stabilize; extraction fixes co-reactant dose to 1 s and omits the 5 s N2O condition and stabilize step. (5) Film composition misreported: atomic ratio given as 1:0.1:0.3 (XPS) conflicts with ED-XRF values In:Ga:Zn = 71.2:7.8:21.0% (Table S3); the method should be ED-XRF, not XPS. (6) Substrate description conflates film and device contexts (films deposited on low-boron-doped Si; devices built on SiO2/Si buffer). (7) Device properties only capture the reference O2 case; selective Ga N2O case with \u03bcFE 106.5 cm2/(V s) and VTH \u22120.47 V is not represented as a separate process; on/off ratio is not reported yet populated. To improve: add separate processes for each reported IGZO ALD condition (O2; N2O 1 s; N2O 5 s; selective N2O on In, Ga, Zn), correct units to match schema (pressure, time, GPC), remove or replace unreported parameters with traceable values, and fix film composition to ED-XRF values with proper method and ratio format."
