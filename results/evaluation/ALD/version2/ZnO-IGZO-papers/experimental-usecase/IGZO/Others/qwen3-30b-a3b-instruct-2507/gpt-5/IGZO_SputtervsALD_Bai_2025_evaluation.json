    "correctness": {
        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Multiple values are ungrounded or incorrect, and at least one schema violation is present. Positives: the ALD method (TALD), precursors (DADI/TMGa/DEZn), supercycle design (In2O3:5, Ga2O3:3, ZnO:4) and sequence, front-layer thickness (10 nm), BI device metrics (\u03bcFE=36.2 cm2/Vs, Vth=0.05 V, SS=82 mV/dec, I_on/I_off\u22481e9), ALD film density (5.60 g/cm3), and band gap for the ALD front layer (3.50 eV) match the article. Issues: (1) Pressure is incorrect and untraceable: the 0.6 value corresponds to sputtering (0.6 Pa) yet the unit set is mmHg (0.6 mmHg \u2248 80 Pa); no ALD pressure was reported. (2) Substrate (\u201cSi wafer\u201d), delivery method (\u201cPulsed delivery\u201d), carrier gas (Ar), purging gas (N2), temperature (200 \u00b0C), dosing/purge times, and flow rates are not reported in the article and appear fabricated. (3) Growth-per-cycle (0.1 \u00c5) and number of cycles (100) are unreported and internally inconsistent with 10 nm thickness. (4) Co-reactant mapping per sub-oxide (H2O for In2O3/ZnO and O3 for Ga2O3) is not specified in the paper; only that H2O and O3 were used as oxygen sources. (5) Reactor metadata: \u201cShanghai Atomic Semiconductor Co.,Ltd.\u201d is a manufacturer; model/name not given in the paper. (6) plasmaPower is set to null (schema expects an object and it\u2019s unnecessary for TALD); this is a schema/type violation\u2014omit this field. (7) Material properties are largely unsubstantiated: refractive index, absorption coefficient, resistivity, carrier density, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, roughness, and atomic ratio are not provided. The \u201celementalConcentration\u201d 5.4% misuses the BI O 1s oxygen-vacancy component and is not an elemental concentration; the atomic ratio \u201c1.0:2.8:5.4\u201d is unsupported. (8) Electrical \u201cmobility\u201d under materialProperties is labeled as Hall but the article did not report Hall data; the mobility value cited is a device metric. (9) Potential omission: a separate ALD process for the Al2O3 gate dielectric (TMA/H2O at 250 \u00b0C) is described in the article but not extracted (may be expected if multiple ALD processes are to be captured). Properties to correct/review: pressure (value/unit and provenance), substrate, temperature, gases, dosing/purge/flow parameters, GPC and cycles, co-reactant assignment, reactor fields, plasmaPower (remove), material property values (refractive index, absorption, resistivity, carrier density, roughness, uniformity, conformality), composition metrics (elemental concentration/atomic ratio), and characterization methods."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Largely incorrect and incomplete relative to the article and the schema. Multiple distinct ALD processes in the paper are not represented (missing the 30 nm IGZO ALD sample SI-A and the ALD Al2O3 gate dielectric process), while only one IGZO ALD process is given. Many parameters are fabricated or not traceable: ALD temperature (200 \u00b0C) not reported; ALD pressure incorrectly taken from sputtering conditions (0.6 Pa) and given with a mmHg unit; substrate (\u201cSi wafer\u201d), carrier/purging gases (Ar/N2), dosing/purge times, flow rates, GPC, number of cycles are all absent from the article. Co-reactant assignment per subcycle (H2O for In/Zn, O3 for Ga) is not stated in the paper (only that H2O and O3 were used). Several material properties are invented or misused: refractive index, absorption, uniformity, conformality, roughness, and XRD-based amorphous claim are not reported; film density unit is wrong (5.60 g cm\u207b\u00b3 in the article should correspond to 5600 g/dm\u00b3 per schema, not 5.6); film composition misuse (5.4% is the O 1s oxygen-vacancy subpeak fraction, not elemental concentration; atomic ratio 1.0:2.8:5.4 is not reported). Device metrics reported (\u03bcFE 36.2 cm\u00b2/Vs, Vth 0.05 V, SS 82 mV/dec, ION/IOFF 1e9) correspond to the bilayer device (BI), not an ALD-only film, causing ambiguity. Schema violations include plasmaPower set to null (must be omitted or a valid object). Supercycle design (5:3:4) and precursors (DADI, TMGa, DEZn) match the text, and band gap 3.50 eV for the ALD front layer is correct, but overall the extraction fails completeness and traceability. Properties to add/review: represent all ALD processes (IGZO SI-A and Al2O3), correct ALD temperature/pressure (or leave unspecified if not in article), remove invented dosing/purge/flow/GPC/cycle values, fix density units, remove unsupported composition/structural metrics, and clarify device metrics association."
