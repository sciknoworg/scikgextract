        "rationale": "Major portions of the extraction are fabricated, not traceable to the article, or violate the schema. Key issues: (1) Supercycle design and precursor mapping are incorrect. The IGZO is deposited via supercycles of In-, Ga-, and Zn-oxide sub-cycles with O3; composition is controlled by the number of TEIn sub-cycles (In/Ga ratio 0.71). The JSON collapses this to a single compound 'InGaZnO' with one subcycle and provides no a:b:c subcycle counts, which contradicts the text. Precursors are lumped into one string for 'InGaZnO' rather than separate entries for In (TEIn), Ga (In\u2013Ga bimetallic precursor), and Zn (DEZn), and co-reactant O3 per subcycle. (2) Many process parameters are invented and ungrounded: pressure (1 mTorr), dosing times, purge times, flow rates, growth per cycle (0.1 \u00c5), number of cycles (100), saturation=True, nucleationPeriod=5 cycles, deliveryMethod, reactor details\u2014all not reported. (3) Placeholders ('Not Found') are used for required fields (carrierGas, purgingGas, reactor, deliveryMethod, safety), which violates the no-placeholder requirement and harms traceability. (4) Schema violation: plasmaPower is set to null but should be omitted if not PEALD. (5) Material properties largely fabricated: refractive index, absorption coefficient, resistivity, carrier density, mobility (Hall), uniformity, conformality, roughness (AFM), film density (and unit value 5.5 g/dm^3 unrealistic), crystallinity/XRD\u2014none are provided in the article. Only the band gap (3.14 eV from SE) is traceable. (6) Film composition is wrong: \u2018atomicRatio\u2019 reported as '0.71:1:1' with XPS; the paper only states In/Ga ratio = 0.71 (by supercycle control) and does not report XPS elemental ratios or Zn fraction. (7) Device properties: subthreshold swing (231.6 mV/dec) and device structure (top-gate-bottom-contact) are correct, and V_ON = \u22121.1 V is given; however, mapping this to 'thresholdVoltage' is ambiguous, and on/off ratio (1e7) is not reported. (8) Temperature (200 \u00b0C) and substrate (SiO2/Si) are correct, and co-reactant O3 is correct; most other fields require correction or removal. Properties to correct/review: supercycleDesign (use InOx/GaOx/ZnO subcycle counts and sequence), reactantSelection (separate precursors per compound; provide real carrier/purging gases if stated or otherwise cannot be filled), remove fabricated pressure, dosing/purge/flow/GPC/cycles/saturation/nucleation values, remove null plasmaPower, revise filmComposition to only the stated In/Ga ratio, remove unreported material/electrical properties, and align deviceProperties to reported metrics only."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Largely incomplete and not traceable. (1) Multiple ALD processes described in the article are not represented: at minimum three IGZO depositions with different channel thicknesses (5, 10, 15 nm; Dev-A, Dev-B, Dev-C) and a control device with different GI (Dev-AL). Only a single process is extracted. (2) Many parameters are fabricated/not grounded in the text: reactor pressure (set to 1 mmHg), GPC (0.1 \u00c5), number of cycles (100), dosing/purge times (100 ms), flow rates (10 sccm), nucleation period (5 cycles), saturation=true, uniformity (5%), conformality AR=10, roughness (1.5 nm), density (5.5 g/dm3), resistivity, carrier density, mobility, on/off ratio. None of these values are reported in the article. (3) Supercycle design is incorrect/incomplete: the article states IGZO was grown by ALD at 200 \u00b0C using TEIn, an In\u2013Ga bimetallic precursor, and DEZn with O3, and the In/Ga ratio was tuned to 0.71 by controlling TEIn sub-cycles. The extraction instead treats IGZO as a single compound without listing sub-cycles for In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO, gives no counts/sequence, and invents an atomic ratio \u201c0.71:1:1\u201d. (4) Reactant selection: carrier and purging gases are left as \u201cNot Found\u201d placeholders (schema requires valid values and the task disallows placeholders); precursors are bundled into one entry for \u201cInGaZnO\u201d rather than per-oxide as described. (5) Material properties: only the SE-derived band gaps (3.11\u20133.14 eV) are supported; other optical/electrical/XRD/AFM/XRR entries are not reported. (6) Device properties: the value entered as threshold voltage (-1.1 V) corresponds to V_ON, not V_TH; mobility and on/off ratio are not reported. (7) Supercycle and composition traceability: no Zn ratio is given in the article; extraction\u2019s ratio is speculative. To improve, add separate processes for Dev-A/B/C (and Dev-AL if included), correct the supercycle to list In2O3/Ga2O3/ZnO sub-cycles and the In/Ga control as reported, and remove/replace all non-traceable parameters (pressure, GPC, times, flows, film properties, and device metrics) with only values explicitly provided in the article."
