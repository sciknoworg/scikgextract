        "rationale": "Several key values are fabricated, unit-mismatched, or internally inconsistent with the article and schema traceability requirements, despite some correct items (PEALD, precursors, co-reactant, 200 \u00b0C, 300 W, 1.2 Torr, substrates, 20 nm film, device structure). Major issues: (1) Dosing times use the schema\u2019s MilliSEC unit but copy seconds from the paper without converting: DADI=1.5 s, TMGa=0.1 s, DEZ=0.1 s should be 1500, 100, 100 ms respectively; co-reactant dose times (100 ms) are not reported in the article. (2) Purge times (10 ms) and all flow rate values are not provided in the paper; they are invented and not traceable. (3) Growth-per-cycle values, number of cycles (100), nucleation period (5 cycles), and supercycle subcycle counts (10/5/15) are not reported and appear fabricated; only film thickness (20 nm) is supported. (4) Reactor manufacturer is not stated in the paper. (5) Material properties: refractive index and absorption coefficient not reported; band gap 3.5 eV is not tied to a specific composition and lacks traceability. (6) Electrical properties: resistivity is not reported; carrier density value uses the C-PER-M3 unit and magnitude inconsistent with the article (which reports Ne in cm^-3; if using PER-M3 it must be converted); mobility under electricalProperties is labeled as Hall but the 43.7 cm^2/Vs value is a device field-effect mobility, not Hall mobility. (7) Device properties mix metrics from different samples: \u03bc_FE=43.7 cm^2/Vs (In_2), V_th\u2248-1.0 V (In_2), I_ON/I_OFF=8.9\u00d710^8 (In_1/Zn_1), yielding an incoherent process; subthreshold swing uses unit MilliV but numeric value 0.25 corresponds to 0.25 mV, not 0.25 V; it should be 250 mV. (8) Film composition/crystallinity are inconsistent: atomic ratio taken from IGZO_In_1 (53.5:33.3:13.2) but crystallinity is set to amorphous, whereas IGZO_In_1 shows cubic-In2O3 peaks; film density 5.4 g/cm^3 corresponds to Ga_4 in SI, not IGZO_In_1/In_2 which are ~6.9\u20136.95 g/cm^3. (9) Uniformity (2.5%) and conformality (AR=10) are not reported. (10) Carrier/purging gas explicitly as Ar is not stated (only Ar/O2 plasma for oxidant is provided). Properties to correct/review: dosingTime units/magnitudes, purgeTime, flowRates, GPC, numberofCycles, nucleationPeriod, supercycleDesign counts, reactor.manufacturer, optical/electrical properties (restrict to reported values and correct units), choose one coherent sample (e.g., IGZO_In_2) and align atomic ratio, crystallinity, film density, and device metrics accordingly; fix SS to 250 mV and carrier density unit to PER-M3 with proper conversion; remove unreported uniformity/conformality."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Largely incomplete and not traceable. The article reports many distinct PEALD IGZO depositions across multiple compositions (L1 and L2 tie-lines; Table S1 and S2), but only a single process instance is extracted. Numerous parameters are fabricated or unit-incorrect: precursor dosing times are reported in the article as 1.5 s (DADI) and 0.1 s (TMGa, DEZ) but are entered as 1.5 and 0.1 MilliSEC (1000\u00d7 too small); co-reactant/purge times and all flow rates are not reported yet provided (100 ms, 10 ms; 5\u2013100 sccm) without grounding; GPC values (0.10\u20130.15 \u00c5/cycle), number of cycles (100), nucleation period (5 cycles), uniformity (2.5%), conformality aspect ratio (10), and supercycle subcycle counts (10/5/15) are not in the paper. Several fields conflict internally with the chosen composition: filmComposition/atomicRatio matches IGZO_In_1 (In:Ga:Zn = 53.5:33.3:13.2), but crystallinity is set to amorphous (In-rich samples show cubic-In2O3 peaks) and film density is set to 5.4 g cm^-3 (value corresponds to Ga_4; In_1 is 6.90 g cm^-3). Electrical properties are mixed or mis-unitized: film mobility is set to 43.7 cm^2/Vs with \u2018Hall\u2019 (article does not report Hall mobility; 43.7 is device \u03bc_FE), carrier density unit is C/m^3 and value (1.5e17) does not convert from cm^-3, and device SS is given as 0.25 mV instead of 0.25 V (250 mV). Device metrics combine values from different samples (e.g., \u03bc_FE 43.7 with I_ON/I_OFF 8.9\u00d710^8 from IGZO_In_1 and V_th ~ \u22121 V from the optimized region). Reactor manufacturer \u201cHanyang University\u201d is not provided. Missing/unsupported but schema-required items (e.g., purge times, flow rates) further reduce completeness. To improve: (1) extract multiple processes for the reported compositions (at least the representative sets on L1/L2), (2) correct units and only include dosing/purge/flow/GPC/cycle counts when explicitly reported (convert 1.5 s to 1500 ms if schema requires ms), (3) align crystallinity and density with the selected composition, and (4) keep device metrics consistent per sample from Table S2."
