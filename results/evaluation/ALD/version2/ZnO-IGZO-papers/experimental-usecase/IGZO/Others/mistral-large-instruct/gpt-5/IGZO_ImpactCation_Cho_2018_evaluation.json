    "correctness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Multiple schema violations, missing values, and factual errors. Examples: (1) Schema violations/missing values: processParameters.plasmaPower is set to null (must be omitted or a valid object); processParameters.pressure.quantityValue.numericValue is null (required numeric); multiple thicknessControl fields have numericValue null (growthPerCycle.values[*].value, numberofCycles), dosingTime.values are null, flowRates.precursorFlow/coReactantFlow numericValue are null, supercycleDesign.numberofSubcycles[*].count has null numericValue. Numerous placeholders (\u201cNot Found\u201d) are used where the schema expects valid strings/numbers (e.g., reactantSelection.precursor[*].precursor). (2) Unit/magnitude errors: purgeTime uses unit MilliSEC with value 10.0, but article states 10 s; should be 10000 ms. subthresholdSwing uses MilliV with value 0.45; article reports 0.40\u20130.46 V/dec, so either unit should be V or the value should be ~400\u2013460 mV. (3) Factual inconsistencies: deviceProperties mixes metrics from different compositions\u2014mobility 39.4 cm^2/V\u00b7s corresponds to In0.38 sample, while thresholdVoltage -4.06 V corresponds to In0.45 sample; values must be from one coherent device. (4) Incorrect or unsupported entries: reactor.manufacturer marked \u201cNot Found\u201d though the article lists CN1 Co., Ltd.; reactantSelection.coReactant uses compound \u201cIGZO\u201d instead of per suboxide; supercycleDesign.subcycleSequence order is wrong (article: In2O3 \u2192 ZnO \u2192 Ga2O3; extracted: In2O3 \u2192 Ga2O3 \u2192 ZnO); flowRates.purgingGasFlow set to 50 sccm but 50 sccm N2 is described as carrier gas, not purge flow; otherAspects.filmStability and reproducibility set True without support. (5) Composition errors: materialProperties.filmComposition.atomicRatio value '1.0:2.8:5.4' and method 'XPS Depth Profile Analysis' are not in the article; composition was measured by XRF and reported as at.% In:Ga:Zn = 38:18:44 etc. elementalConcentration provides a single 38% without specifying element, making it ambiguous. (6) Duplications/inconsistencies: thicknessControl.filmThickness appears both inside growthPerCycle and at the thicknessControl root (duplicate). Overall, many required numeric fields are null, several values are incorrect or not traceable, and the process is not coherent with the article. These issues should be corrected as noted."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and contains multiple inconsistencies with both the article and the schema. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes not captured: the article reports three distinct IGZO compositions (In0.38Ga0.18Zn0.44O, In0.42Ga0.15Zn0.43O, In0.45Ga0.15Zn0.40O) with different device metrics; only one process is provided and it mixes parameters across samples (e.g., \u03bcFE=39.4 cm2/Vs from Sample A combined with VTH=-4.06 V and SS=0.45 V/dec from Sample C). (2) Schema violations and nulls: many required numeric fields are null (pressure, GPC values, number of cycles, dosing times, co-reactant flows, nucleation period, uniformity, conformality, roughness, film density, electrical properties), and placeholders like \u201cNot Found\u201d are used instead of valid values. (3) Unit errors: purge time is recorded as 10 ms rather than the reported 10 s; SS is given as 0.45 mV instead of 0.45 V/dec (i.e., 450 mV/dec). (4) Reactant mapping incomplete/incorrect: coReactant is listed once for \u201cIGZO\u201d instead of per subcomponent; O3 generator feed (970 sccm O2 + 30 sccm N2, 250 g/m3 O3) is omitted; precursor names are not provided (may be absent in text, but extraction should avoid invalid placeholders). (5) Supercycle design incorrect/incomplete: subcycle sequence order is wrong (should be In2O3, ZnO, Ga2O3) and subcycle counts are missing. (6) Reactor details missing: the article specifies a traveling-wave-type ALD tool (CN1 Co., Ltd.), but the extraction has \u201cNot Found.\u201d (7) Composition fields flawed: elemental concentration is a single 38% without mapping to an element; the atomic ratio \u20181.0:2.8:5.4\u2019 is not traceable to the article and appears incorrect. (8) Ungrounded entries: purging gas flow 50 sccm is used, but 50 sccm N2 was reported as carrier gas, not purge; film stability/reproducibility are set to True without support. Properties to add/review: split into three processes (A/B/C) with coherent device metrics; correct subcycle sequence; reactor name/manufacturer; delivery method (bypass-type injection); proper purge/dose times and units; per-compound co-reactant entries; remove nulls/placeholders; correct SS units; include Hall carrier densities; and correct composition fields per Table 1."
