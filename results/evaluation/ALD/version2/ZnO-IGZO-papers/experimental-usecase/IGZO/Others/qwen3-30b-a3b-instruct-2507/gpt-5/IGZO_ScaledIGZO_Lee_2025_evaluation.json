        "rationale": "Largely not traceable to the article and contains multiple inaccuracies and invented parameters. Key issues: (1) ALD method set to PEALD with 50 W plasma and 'remote plasma' delivery, but the article only states ALD at 225 \u00b0C for IGZO and does not report plasma use for the IGZO channel (only the Al2O3 gate dielectric used PE-ALD). (2) Co-reactant O3, reactor model (Picosun R200), chamber pressure (0.5 mmHg), plasma power, carrier/purging gases, dosing and purge times, and all flow rates are not reported in the paper. (3) Supercycle design is incorrect: the work explicitly studies compositions 2:1:1, 5:1:1, and 7:1:1, but the extraction fixes 1:1:1 and does not represent multiple processes for the different compositions as required. (4) Thickness-control details (GPC and number of cycles = 48, nucleation period = 5 cycles, saturation = true) are not provided by the article. (5) Many material properties are fabricated: refractive index, absorption, band gap (Tauc/UV-Vis), resistivity, carrier density (Hall), uniformity, conformality, roughness (AFM), and film density (XRR) are not reported. (6) Film composition entries (XPS depth profile, atomic ratio 1.0:2.8:5.4) are unsupported and inconsistent with the stated subcycle ratios. (7) Device properties: only the field-effect mobility value (36.6 cm^2/V\u00b7s) is supported (maximum for 7:1:1). Threshold voltage (0.5 V), SS (68 mV/dec), and on/off ratio (1e11) are not reported for these devices in this paper (68 mV/dec is from a cited reference, not this work). (8) Post-fabrication oxygen anneal (290 \u00b0C, 60 s) that critically affects results is not represented. Overall, most populated fields are not grounded in the text, some contradict the article (e.g., composition ratio), and multiple distinct processes (different In:Ga:Zn supercycle ratios, and with/without anneal) are not extracted."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely ungrounded in the article and misses key processes and schema-relevant details that are actually reported. Major issues: (1) Multiple processes not captured: the article reports three IGZO supercycle compositions (In:Ga:Zn = 2:1:1, 5:1:1, 7:1:1) and two additional ALD processes (8-nm Al2O3 adhesion layer and 5-nm Al2O3 gate dielectric via PE-ALD at 200 \u00b0C). Only one process is provided and its supercycleDesign uses 1:1:1 counts, contradicting the reported compositions. (2) Unsupported/incorrect parameters: ALD method set to PEALD for IGZO, use of O3 co-reactant, reactor model (Picosun R200), plasma power (50 W), pressure, carrier/purging gases, dosing/purge times, flow rates, growth-per-cycle, saturation, nucleation period, and supercycle sequence are not stated in the article and are therefore not traceable. (3) Material properties not reported in the paper are fabricated (refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap and method, resistivity, Hall carrier density and mobility, uniformity, conformality, roughness, film density, XPS-based elemental concentration and atomic ratio). (4) Device properties partly incorrect or untraceable: \u03bc_FE = 36.6 cm^2/V\u00b7s is mentioned but corresponds only to 7:1:1; threshold voltage, subthreshold swing (68 mV), and on/off ratio (1e11) are not reported in this article. (5) Post-anneal (290 \u00b0C O2, 60 s) that strongly affects results is not represented. To improve: represent each ALD process separately (IGZO for 2:1:1, 5:1:1, 7:1:1; Al2O3 adhesion; Al2O3 gate dielectric), correct IGZO ALD method (TALD unless plasma is explicitly stated), set supercycle counts to the reported ratios, include only parameters traceable to the text (temperature 225 \u00b0C and 4.8 nm thickness for IGZO; 200 \u00b0C and PEALD for gate dielectric), and remove or review all unsubstantiated values (co-reactant, reactor, plasma power, pressure, times/flows, GPC, material/film property metrics, device V_TH/SS/ION/IOFF)."
