    "correctness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction contains numerous ungrounded or incorrect values and several schema-incoherent entries. Key issues: (1) ReactantSelection: Precursors (TEIn, DEZn, TMGa) and co-reactant (O3) are not reported in the article for IGZO; IGZO ALD details are explicitly deferred to ref. [5]. CarrierGas and purgingGas set to 'Not Found' (non-traceable placeholders). (2) ProcessParameters: Temperature 250 \u00b0C is stated for SiO2 (PECVD/PEALD), not for IGZO; assigning 250 \u00b0C to IGZO is incorrect. Plasma power and pressure are unknown yet set to 0, which is implausible for PEALD and not supported. DosingTime, PurgeTime, FlowRates, GrowthPerCycle, NumberofCycles are all set to 0\u2014fabricated/incorrect. Saturation and nucleationPeriod are also asserted without evidence. (3) SupercycleDesign: The InOx\u00d712\u2013GaOx\u00d71\u2013ZnO\u00d71 supercycle and sequence are correct and traceable. (4) ThicknessControl.filmThickness: 20 nm is correct. (5) MaterialProperties: Multiple fabricated zeros (refractiveIndex, bandGap, resistivity, carrierDensity, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, roughness, filmDensity). AtomicRatio '1:2.8:5.4' is not in the article and should be removed. Crystallinity 'Amorphous' is consistent with the text. (6) DeviceProperties: Mobility (21.11 cm^2/V\u00b7s) and Vth (0.82 V) match device B. However, subthresholdSwing is 0.22 V/dec in the paper; the schema unit provided is MilliV, but the extraction puts 0.22 mV\u2014off by ~1000\u00d7 and wrong unit interpretation. OnOffRatio is set to 0 (not reported). DeviceStructure 'Top-gate bottom-contact' is correct. (7) OtherAspects: Safety 'Not Found', filmStability False, reproducibility False are unsupported. To correct: remove fabricated precursor/co-reactant and gas entries or replace with values explicitly stated; remove or leave out unknown parameters instead of zero values; do not assign SiO2 process temperature to IGZO; fix subthreshold swing to 220 mV or adjust unit to V if allowed; delete unsupported atomic ratio and other zeroed material properties unless reported; keep only traceable, article-backed values."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect and incomplete relative to the article and the schema. Major issues: (1) Reactants and precursors are untraceable: TEIn, DEZn, TMGa and O3 are not reported anywhere in the paper for IGZO PEALD; carrier/purging gases are set to \u201cNot Found.\u201d (2) Many process parameters are invented or invalid: plasmaPower=0 W, pressure=0, dosing/purge times and flow rates=0, growth-per-cycle=0, numberofCycles=0, saturation=False, nucleationPeriod=0 \u2014 none are reported in the article. (3) Temperature 250 \u00b0C is taken from SiO2 processes and not reported for IGZO PEALD, so it is likely incorrect. (4) Material properties contain fabricated/zero values (refractive index, resistivity, carrier density, roughness=0 nm, film density=0), and a non-evidenced IGZO atomic ratio (1:2.8:5.4). Only \u201camorphous\u201d and 20 nm thickness are supported. (5) Device properties: SS is reported as 0.22 V/dec in the article but encoded as 0.22 mV (wrong by 10^3) and unit type mismatches the article\u2019s \u201cV/dec.\u201d On/off ratio is set to 0 without source. (6) The article describes two relevant ALD processes: IGZO PEALD and PEALD SiO2 gate insulator; only one process is provided, and the PEALD SiO2 process (DIPAS, Ar+O2 plasma, 250 \u00b0C, 100 nm, density 2.25 g/cm3, rms ~0.04 nm) is missing. (7) Reactor details, delivery method, carrier/purging gas values are absent or placeholders, violating traceability. Properties to add or review: correct reactantSelection (or mark as not reported without fabricating), processParameters (temperature for IGZO if reported; otherwise omit fabrications), non-zero/traceable thicknessControl, dosing/purge/flow values only if given, correct SS magnitude and unit, remove fabricated composition/optical/electrical properties, add a second process for PEALD SiO2 with DIPAS, Ar+O2 plasma at 250 \u00b0C and reported film properties."
