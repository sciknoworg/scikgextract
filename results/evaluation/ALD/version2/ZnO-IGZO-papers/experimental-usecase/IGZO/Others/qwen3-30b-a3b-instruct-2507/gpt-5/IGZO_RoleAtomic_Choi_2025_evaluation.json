        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues throughout. Key problems: (1) Schema violations: processParameters.plasmaPower is null (must be an object or omitted); an extra processParameters.filmThickness property is present (filmThickness belongs inside thicknessControl); multiple fields (e.g., dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates) have values not grounded in the article. (2) Misinterpreted/ungrounded parameters: processParameters.pressure=30 mTorr is taken from precursor vapor pressures, not reactor pressure; purgingGas='Ar' is not stated; nucleationPeriod=5 cycles, dosing/purge times (100 ms), and flowRates (25 sccm for all streams) are not reported; numberofCycles=10 is not given. (3) Supercycle design partly incorrect/underspecified: article states (In 3 cycles + Zn 1 cycle) repeated k times, followed by Ga 1 cycle; the provided subcycleSequence ['In2O3','ZnO','Ga2O3'] does not capture the k-repetition and post-Ga ordering; atomicRatio '3:1:1' labeled as XPS is not a measured ratio. (4) Material properties largely fabricated: optical properties (n, absorption, band gap, Tauc plot), roughness (AFM 1.2 nm), film density (5.2 g/dm3), uniformity (5%) and conformality (AR=10) are not reported. (5) Electrical properties section mislabeled and/or incorrect: resistivity and carrier density not given; mobility is assigned 59 cm^2/Vs with 'Hall measurements' (the paper reports TFT mobility from I\u2013V, not Hall; 59 cm^2/Vs corresponds to IZO, while the device metrics provided correspond to IGZO); subthresholdSwing uses 0.13 with unit MilliV (schema unit) but the article reports 0.13 V/dec\u2014value is off by 1000\u00d7; onOffRatio is given as 34.6 (unitless) but the table reports 34.6\u00d710^6, off by 10^6. (6) Inconsistent device mapping: thresholdVoltage \u22123.85 V and SS 0.13 V/dec correspond to 3IZGO, but mobility 59 cm^2/Vs corresponds to IZO; mixing devices breaks coherence. (7) filmComposition.elementalConcentration=41.2% (XPS) is untraceable and unspecified (which element?); the article reports composition trends (e.g., Ga 41\u219212%, In 31\u219255%) rather than a single 41.2%. (8) Missing multiplicity: the article reports several distinct processes/recipes (2\u20135 IZO, 1\u20133 IZGO, IZGO_S/L); only one process instance is provided. Overall, many values are non-traceable, some are incorrect or mismatched to different samples, and there are schema compliance issues."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Major incompleteness and factual misalignment. (1) Multiple reported processes are not captured. The article describes distinct ALD processes/variants (2IZO\u20135IZO; 1IZGO, 2IZGO, 3IZGO; and IZGO_S vs IZGO_L), but only a single process is extracted. (2) Supercycle design is under-specified: no k (number of repetitions), no representation of the S/L bilayer-period variants, and the subcycle sequence is oversimplified relative to \u201crepeat In(3) + Zn(1) for k, then Ga(1)\u201d. (3) Numerous process parameters are fabricated or misassigned: dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates (including co-reactant and purge gas flows), nucleationPeriod, numberofCycles, and reactor pressure. The 30 mTorr value in the article refers to precursor vapor pressure in the canister (not chamber deposition pressure). (4) Material properties include many unreported values (refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, roughness, film density, uniformity, conformality, resistivity, carrier density, Hall mobility, crystallinity assignment) that are not provided in the article, violating traceability. (5) Composition is misrepresented: \u201catomicRatio 3:1:1\u201d is not reported; elemental concentration 41.2% is unspecified to which element; the article provides trends and ranges, not a single fixed composition. (6) Device properties are internally inconsistent and unit-incorrect: mobility 59 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s corresponds to IZO (Table S1) while Vth = \u22123.85 V, SS = 0.13 V/dec, and Ion/Ioff = 34.6\u00d710^6 correspond to 3IZGO (Table S2). The extraction reports SS as 0.13 mV (should be 130 mV or 0.13 V) and Ion/Ioff as 34.6 (should be 3.46e7). (7) Some items are correct (precursors DADI/DEZ/TMGa, ozone, reactor IC-100 (MOMAN), Ts = 210 \u00b0C, and GPCs from Fig. S1), but overall the record is not a coherent, traceable process instance and does not comply with schema intent. Properties to add/review: add separate process entries for each reported sample (2\u20135 IZO; 1\u20133 IZGO; IZGO_S/L), correct supercycle details (including k), correct device metrics with proper units/magnitudes from Tables S1\u2013S3, remove or correct pressure, dosing/purge/flow/nucleation/numberofCycles unless explicitly reported, and revise composition fields to reflect reported XPS data with clear element attribution."
