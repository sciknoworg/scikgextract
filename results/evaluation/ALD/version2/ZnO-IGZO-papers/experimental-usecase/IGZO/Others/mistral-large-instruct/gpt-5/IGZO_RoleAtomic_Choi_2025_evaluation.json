        "rationale": "Major schema violations and numerous untraceable or incorrect values. Key issues: (1) Schema compliance: processParameters.plasmaPower is set to null but must be an object or omitted; required fields (saturation, nucleationPeriod, dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, filmThickness) are incorrectly nested under thicknessControl instead of being direct children of processParameters; filmThickness is also incorrectly placed inside growthPerCycle. (2) Conflation of processes: aldSystem/materialDeposited and supercycleDesign include Ga (IGZO), but deviceProperties correspond to IZO (no Ga) from Table S1 (\u03bc_FE=59 cm^2/V\u00b7s, Vth=-7.36 V, SS=0.18 V/dec). If representing IGZO (e.g., 3IZGO), deviceProperties should be \u03bc_FE=39.8, Vth=-3.85, SS=0.13 V/dec, Ion/Ioff=34.6\u00d710^6 (Table S2); otherwise set materialDeposited=IZO and remove Ga from supercycleDesign. (3) Units/magnitudes: subthresholdSwing provided as 0.18 mV (schema unit) instead of 0.18 V/dec \u2192 should be 180 mV/dec; onOffRatio given as 92.6 but Table S1 reports 92.6\u00d710^6; flowRates use QUDT unit SCM-PER-MIN (m^3/min) for 25 sccm and apply 25 to all flows (precursor, co-reactant, purge), which is incorrect and ungrounded. (4) Untraceable process parameters: reactor pressure (30 mTorr) is taken from precursor vapor pressure, not reactor pressure; numberofCycles=10, nucleationPeriod=1 cycle, dosingTime/purgeTime=1 ms are not reported; coReactantFlow/precursorFlow values are not provided in the article (only Ar carrier gas at 25 sccm is stated). (5) Material properties largely fabricated and untraceable: refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, film uniformity, conformality, roughness, density, elemental concentration (33%), atomic ratio (1.0:2.8:5.4), and crystallinity (\u201camorphous\u201d) are not reported. (6) Supercycle design incomplete: article describes variants (1IZGO, 2IZGO, 3IZGO) and IZGO_S vs IZGO_L; only one process extracted; multiple distinct processes should be represented. Corrections needed: remove or properly structure plasmaPower and thicknessControl section per schema; restrict values to those traceable (temperature=210 \u00b0C, GPCs, film thickness=10 nm, precursors/ozone, carrier gas=Ar); correct deviceProperties to match the chosen process; fix SS and Ion/Ioff units/magnitudes; do not fabricate missing material properties; extract multiple processes (IZO series and IGZO variants) as separate objects."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and weakly traceable to the article. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes described in the paper are not captured: separate ALD runs for IZO with varying In sub-cycles (2IZO, 3IZO, 4IZO, 5IZO), IGZO variants with different Ga insertion frequencies (1IZGO, 2IZGO, 3IZGO), and bilayer-period variants (IZGO_S vs IZGO_L). Only one process is provided, losing essential supercycle-dependent differences reported in Tables S1\u2013S3 and Figs. 3\u20136. (2) Supercycle design is incomplete: the k repetitions of (In 3 + Zn 1) before a Ga cycle and the S/L bilayer-period variants are not represented; the provided subcycleSequence and counts do not encode k or the period differences. (3) Device properties are inconsistent and partially wrong: values shown (\u03bc_FE=59, Vth=\u22127.36, SS=0.18) correspond to IZO (Table S1), yet materialDeposited is IGZO; subthreshold swing unit is incorrect (0.18 entered as mV should be 180 mV). (4) Several process parameters are not reported in the article and appear fabricated: dosingTime, purgeTime, numberofCycles, reactant/ozone flow rates per compound; reactor pressure is misinterpreted from precursor vapor pressures (~10\u201330 mTorr) and is not the deposition pressure. (5) Material properties largely lack grounding: optical constants (n, bandgap, absorption), resistivity, carrier density, Hall mobility, uniformity, conformality, roughness, film density, and specific elemental concentration/atomic ratio values are not provided in the article; the given numbers are not traceable. (6) Schema issues: plasmaPower is set to null (violates type); subthreshold swing unit/value mismatch; pressure value/unit likely incorrect. To improve, add distinct process entries for each IZO and IGZO configuration (2\u20135IZO; 1\u20133IZGO; IZGO_S/L) with their specific supercycle designs and device metrics; remove or correct unreported parameters (pressure, dosing/purge times, flows, number of cycles); correct SS units; and limit material properties to those actually reported (e.g., XRD phase, XPS trends, film thickness)."
