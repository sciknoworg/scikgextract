        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues. Examples: (1) Reactants/precursors: TMGa, DEZ, and an \u201cIn\u2013Ga bimetallic precursor\u201d are not reported in the article; only \u201cindium precursor,\u201d \u201cGa and Zn precursors,\u201d and ozone are mentioned. Precursor identities are therefore untraceable/incorrect. (2) Pressure: 2 mTorr given in the article is for sputtering, not ALD. The extracted ALD pressure \u201c2\u201d with unit MilliM_HG (\u22482 Torr) is both misattributed and orders of magnitude wrong. (3) Dosing/purging times: Article states purge time 10 s for each metal precursor and O3; extraction uses 10 ms for both dosing and purge (wrong value and units). (4) Flow rates: Article gives 970 sccm O2 + 30 sccm N2 to the O3 generator and 50 sccm N2 as the carrier for precursors; extraction sets 50 (SCM-PER-MIN) uniformly for precursor/co-reactant/purge for all compounds\u2014incorrect and not traceable. (5) Thickness control: number of cycles (100), GPC (0.1 \u00c5), and nucleation period (10) are not reported; GPC\u00d7cycles does not yield the stated 16 nm; supercycle counts (1:1:1) are not substantiated and unlikely to give the reported 50:34:16 composition. (6) Material properties: Film density is reported as 5.60 g/cm\u00b3; extraction uses unit GM-PER-DeciM3 with value 5.6, which corresponds to 5.6 g/L (1000\u00d7 off). Optical properties (n, band gap, absorption) and AFM roughness are not reported; absorptionCoefficient unit PER-CENTI-M violates schema (schema allows UNITLESS). Film composition method is given as XPS, while the article reports composition by XRF (calibrated by PIXE). (7) Electrical properties: Carrier density in article is 4.7\u00d710^18 cm^-3 (from I\u2013V), not 1\u00d710^18 C/m\u00b3; the unit/type is also inconsistent. Mobility listed under materialProperties as \u201cHall\u201d is not supported by the article. (8) Device properties: Subthreshold swing should be ~0.41\u20130.49 V/dec; extraction encodes 0.41 mV (1000\u00d7 error). Threshold voltage for the ALD device is not explicitly provided in the text; 0.5 V is unsubstantiated. (9) Schema violations: plasmaPower is set to null though the schema type is object (should be omitted); opticalProperties.absorptionCoefficient unit not in allowed enum. Many other fields (uniformity, conformality, reproducibility, safety) are speculative. Correct/replace: pressure, dosing/purge times, flow rates, precursors, GPC/cycles/supercycle counts, film density unit/value, carrier density value/unit, SS unit/magnitude, composition method, and remove unsupported optical/AFM/Hall data; omit plasmaPower if not used."

        "rationale": "Many fields are fabricated, unit-incorrect, or not traceable to the article, and there are schema issues. Key problems: (1) Reactants: Specific precursors (TMGa, DEZ, \u201cIn\u2013Ga bimetallic precursor\u201d) are not provided in the article; only ozone as oxidant, N2 carrier (50 sccm), and canister temperatures are reported. These precursor entries must be revised to match the text or removed if unknown. (2) Timing: Purge time is reported as 10 s for each precursor and O3; the extraction uses 10 ms (and invents dosing times). Units should be corrected to 10 s (i.e., 10000 ms if using MilliSEC). (3) Pressure: 2 mTorr is a sputtering condition; ALD chamber pressure is not reported. The filled value (2 MilliM_HG) is ungrounded and unit-inconsistent. (4) Flow rates: Article provides 50 sccm N2 carrier for precursors and the O3 generator feeds (970 sccm O2 + 30 sccm N2) with 200 g/m3 O3 concentration; precursor/co-reactant/purge flows per compound at 50 sccm are not reported and should be removed or replaced with traceable values. (5) Supercycle/GPC/cycles/nucleation: Counts (1:1:1), GPC (0.1 \u00c5), total cycles (100), and nucleation period (10 cycles) are not given in the paper; they must be omitted or justified. (6) Material properties: Optical constants, resistivity, uniformity, conformality, and AFM roughness are not reported; carrier density is reported as 4.7\u00d710^18 cm^-3 (\u22484.7\u00d710^24 m^-3), but the extraction uses 1\u00d710^18 C/m^3 with wrong unit and magnitude; characterization method is not Hall. (7) Device properties: Subthreshold swing should be ~0.41 V/dec; the extraction uses 0.41 MilliV (wrong unit/scale). ALD VTH is not provided; 0.5 V is unsubstantiated. (8) Schema compliance: plasmaPower is set to null (violates schema); several required fields are populated with non-traceable guesses. Correct/verify: precursors, purge/dose times and units, pressure, flow rates, GPC/number of cycles/supercycle counts, carrier density with correct unit conversion, SS units (use 410 mV/dec if adhering to schema), and remove unreported optical/uniformity/conformality/resistivity/roughness or replace with cited values. Retained correct items include: ALD method (thermal), substrate, temperature (250 \u00b0C), oxidant (O3), film thickness (16 nm), amorphous phase (XRD/TEM), composition In:Ga:Zn=50:34:16 (atomic ratio consistent), film density ~5.60 g/cm\u00b3, mobility 36.6 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s, and ION/OFF ~1\u00d710^7."
