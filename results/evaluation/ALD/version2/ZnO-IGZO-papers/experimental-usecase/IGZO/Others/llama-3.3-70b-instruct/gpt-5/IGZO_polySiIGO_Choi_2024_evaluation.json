    "correctness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incorrect and not schema-compliant. Key issues: (1) Schema violations: plasmaPower is set to null (type must be object or omitted); dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, saturation, nucleationPeriod, and filmThickness are incorrectly nested inside thicknessControl rather than at the processParameters level; growthPerCycle incorrectly contains filmThickness; placeholders like 'Not Found' violate the requirement of no empty/placeholder values. (2) Factual misalignment/untraceable values: Many parameters are fabricated and not in the article (GPC=0.1 \u00c5; numberofCycles=100; dosing/purge times=1 ms; precursor/ozone flow rates=100 sccm; uniformity 5%; conformality AR=10; refractive index=2.0; absorption coefficient=1000; band gap=3.3 eV; resistivity=100 \u03a9\u00b7m; mobility=10 cm2/Vs; carrier density=1e19 m\u22123; film density=6 g/dm3; device on/off=1000). The article provides none of these. Film composition marked as measured by XPS is not reported. (3) Process inconsistency: materialDeposited is IGZO, but temperature is 250 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the selected IGO deposition, while IGZO in this work is reported at 400 \u00b0C (Table 1). Crystallinity set to amorphous is plausible for IGZO at 400 \u00b0C but inconsistent with the chosen 250 \u00b0C. CarrierGas set to Argon is not explicitly stated (only purge gas Ar=100 sccm is given). Substrate 'Si wafer' is not specified for ALD films. (4) Incorrect/contradictory claims: otherAspects.filmStability=True contradicts the reported degradation/insulating behavior of IGZO after 800 \u00b0C. (5) Missing processes: The article describes ALD of both IGO (main channel, In:Ga=4:1, 250 \u00b0C, post-anneal 800 \u00b0C) and IGZO (In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1); only one process is provided and it mixes parameters from both, undermining coherence. (6) Limited correct items: Use of ozone coreactant, Ar purge gas (100 sccm) and 300 mTorr pressure, and precursors (DADI-type indium precursor, TMGa, DEZ) align with the article; supercycle ratio 1:1:1 for IGZO is consistent. Overall, most entries are untraceable or contradictory and several schema constraints are violated. Properties to correct/review: restructure processParameters to meet schema; remove null/placeholder values; align materialDeposited and temperature with the correct process (separate IGO and IGZO processes); only include dosing/purge/flow/GPC and material/device properties that are explicitly reported; correct filmStability per material; verify crystallinity, device metrics, and composition against the text."

        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and contains many non-traceable or incorrect values. Only one process (IGZO) is provided, while the article describes multiple ALD processes that should be separate: IGO supercycles at several In:Ga ratios (1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 7:1) with deposition at 200\u2013350 \u00b0C and post-anneal at 800 \u00b0C, IGZO ALD (In:Ga:Zn = 1:1:1), and In2O3 ALD used for comparison. Numerous parameters are fabricated or mismatched to the text: growth-per-cycle, dosing/purge times, nucleation period, number of cycles, and precursor/oxidant flow rates (set to 100 with unit SCM-PER-MIN, inconsistent with the reported 100 sccm Ar purge and no flows given for precursors/ozone). Many material/device properties are invented or conflict with reported values (e.g., device \u03bc_FE, V_th, SS; Hall mobility/resistivity/carrier density; optical properties; uniformity/conformality), and crystallinity is set to amorphous although IGO becomes cubic after 800 \u00b0C. There is a schema violation (plasmaPower set to null) and placeholder strings (\u201cNot Found\u201d). Required additions/revisions: extract distinct processes for IGO (with 4:1 supercycle used in devices and other tested ratios), IGZO (1:1:1), and In2O3; use traceable deposition temperature (IGO 250 \u00b0C), pressure (300 mTorr), purge gas and flow (Ar 100 sccm), co-reactant (ozone, 300 g m\u22123); correct supercycle counts (e.g., IGO 4:1, IGZO 1:1:1); replace speculative timings/flows/GPC with documented values or omit optional fields; populate crystallinity and Hall/device metrics with reported numbers (e.g., IGO FET \u03bc_FE \u2248 103.66 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s, V_th \u2248 \u22120.94 V, SS \u2248 96 mV/dec; IGZO ALD \u03bc_FE \u2248 30.3 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s) and remove null/placeholder entries."
