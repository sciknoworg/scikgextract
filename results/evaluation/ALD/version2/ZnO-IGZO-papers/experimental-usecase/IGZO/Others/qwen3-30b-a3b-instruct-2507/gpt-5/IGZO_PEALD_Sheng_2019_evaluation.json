        "rationale": "The extraction contains multiple factual errors, ungrounded values, unit mistakes, and schema violations. Key issues: (1) Schema violations: dosingTime, purgeTime, flowRates, saturation, nucleationPeriod, and filmThickness are incorrectly nested inside thicknessControl instead of at the processParameters level (schema requires them at processParameters). (2) Film thickness misinterpreted: 1.8 nm is the In2O3 sublayer thickness label (IGZO1.8nm), while the deposited IGZO film used in TFTs is 20 nm; processParameters.filmThickness should be 20 nm. (3) Growth per cycle units/numbers wrong: article gives 0.08, 0.12, 0.22 nm/cycle for InOx, GaOx, ZnO; extraction uses 0.08, 0.12, 0.22 \u00c5 (10\u00d7 too small). (4) Device subthreshold swing units wrong: reported 0.26 V/dec but encoded as 0.26 mV (should be 260 mV or 0.26 V). (5) Field-effect mobility mis-assigned: property fieldEffectMobility uses 74.3 cm2/Vs (\u03bc_sat), while \u03bc_eff is 65.5 cm2/Vs for IGZO1.8nm; either map to \u03bc_eff or clearly denote saturation mobility (schema only provides fieldEffectMobility). (6) Atomic ratio element order incorrect: article ratio is In:Zn:Ga = 2.8:1.7:1; extraction lists elements ['In','Ga','Zn'] with the same ratio, mismatching element order. (7) Carrier density unit/value incorrect: article gives 7.1\u00d710^17 cm^-3; extraction uses 7.1e17 with unit C-PER-M3. It should be PER-M3 and converted to 7.1e23 m^-3. (8) Film density unit mismatch: 6.76 g/cm3 was entered as 6.76 GM-PER-DeciM3; if using g/dm3, it must be ~6760 GM-PER-DeciM3. (9) Numerous ungrounded parameters: plasmaPower (50 W), pressure (0.1 mTorr), dosing/purge times (100 ms), flow rates, refractive index (1.8), absorptionCoefficient (0.05), uniformity (2.5%), conformality aspect ratio (10), reactor manufacturer, etc. are not reported in the article. (10) Supercycle/numberofSubcycles: InOx \u00d720, ZnO \u00d71, GaOx \u00d71 is plausible for IGZO1.8nm but total number of ALD cycles to reach 20 nm is not provided and should not be guessed. Properties to correct/review: processParameters nesting to comply with schema; filmThickness (20 nm); GPC values and units; SS units; fieldEffectMobility value; atomicRatio element order; carrierDensity units/value; filmDensity units; remove or mark unknown all unreported parameters (plasma power, pressure, timing, flow, refractive index, absorption, uniformity, conformality)."

        "rationale": "Major portions of the extracted process are not traceable to the article, several key values are incorrect, and multiple experiments reported are not captured. Specific issues: (1) Many parameters are fabricated/not reported in the article: plasmaPower (50 W), reactor pressure (0.1 mTorr), dosing/purge times, flow rates, nucleationPeriod, uniformity variation, conformality aspect ratio, resistivity, refractive index value (and method; article used ellipsometry), absorption coefficient, and a blanket \u201csaturation\u201d flag. (2) Unit/value errors: GPC values are off by 10\u00d7 and in wrong units (article: 0.08/0.12/0.22 nm per cycle; extraction uses 0.08/0.12/0.22 \u00c5; should be 0.8/1.2/2.2 \u00c5); subthreshold swing is given as 0.26 mV but should be 0.26 V (i.e., 260 mV); carrier density is entered as 7.1e17 C\u00b7m^-3 but the article reports 7.1\u00d710^17 cm^-3; correct entry should use PER-M3 and convert to ~7.1\u00d710^23 m^-3 (or use proper C\u00b7m^-3 if multiplying by e). (3) Film thickness is misinterpreted: 1.8 nm in the article is the In2O3 sublayer thickness within the supercycle (IGZO1.8nm), not the total film thickness; the actual device channel films are 20 nm. (4) Atomic ratio mapping is inconsistent: elements listed as [In, Ga, Zn] but the ratio string corresponds to In:Zn:Ga (2.8:1.7:1); either change elements to [In, Zn, Ga] or the ratio to 2.8:1:1.7. (5) growthPerCycle.numberofCycles (20) is not supported by the article as total ALD cycles; the paper varies n (InOx subcycles per supercycle) from 4 to 20 and does not report total cycles. (6) Multiple processes are not represented: the paper reports a series of IGZO films (IGZO0.3nm, 0.7nm, 1.0nm, 1.4nm, 1.8nm) with distinct properties; only one instance is extracted. Properties to add/review: correct GPC with units, correct SS unit/value, correct carrier density unit and conversion, correct total film thickness (20 nm) and clarify sublayer thickness in supercycle design, fix atomic ratio ordering, remove or justify any unreported parameters (pressure, plasma power, timings, flows, uniformity/conformality, resistivity, refractive index/absorption), and consider extracting separate processes for each n value described."
