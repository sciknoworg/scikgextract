    "correctness": {
        "rating": "2",
        "rationale": "Multiple major issues reduce correctness and schema compliance. Key problems: (1) Schema violations and unit errors: plasmaPower is set to null (schema expects an object or it should be omitted); deviceProperties.subthresholdSwing uses unit MilliV with value 0.43 (should be 430 mV for 0.43 V/dec); electricalProperties.carrierDensity uses PER-M3 but copies 4.7e16 cm^-3 without conversion (should be ~4.7e22 m^-3); filmDensity unit GM-PER-DeciM3 (g/L) with 5.2 is unsupported and implausible for a solid thin film; aldSystem.reactor.manufacturer set to \"South Korea\" (a country, not a manufacturer). (2) Unsupported/fabricated parameters lacking traceability: reactor pressure (10 mmHg) not reported; growthPerCycle 0.1 \u00c5 and numberofCycles 150 not reported (Figure S1 shows GPC vs T but no numeric values provided here); dosingTime 1000 ms and all flowRates are not given in the paper; supercycleDesign counts (10/5/2) not reported; uniformity (5%), conformality aspect ratio (10), refractiveIndex (1.9), absorptionCoefficient (0.01), filmDensity (5.2 g/dm^3), and deviceStructure are not provided in the article. (3) Incorrect/partially incorrect values: materialProperties.opticalProperties.characterizationMethod is listed as UV-Vis, but the article states spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used to measure band gap; filmComposition.atomicRatio '1.0:2.8:5.4' contradicts the reported base-layer composition (In 52 at%, Ga 29 at%, Zn 19 at%; a consistent ratio would be ~5.2:2.9:1.9 or '52:29:19'); carrier/purging gas set to N2 without explicit mention in the article (not traceable); reactor 'manufacturer' field incorrect as noted. (4) Mixed correctness: Some fields are correct and traceable: precursors (DADI, TMGa, DEZ) and co-reactant O3; substrate temperature 250 \u00b0C; purge time 10 s (encoded as 10,000 ms); substrate p-Si with 100 nm thermal SiO2; base-layer composition In0.52Ga0.29Zn0.19O, roughness ~0.21 nm, amorphous phase; device metrics for base-layer on SiO2 (\u03bc_FE 18.2 cm^2/Vs, V_TH 0.57 V, SS 0.43 V/dec, I_ON/OFF ~8.3\u00d710^7). (5) Process completeness: The article describes multiple ALD processes (base-layer only, boost-layer only, bilayer IGZO supercycle, and variations with different gate dielectrics), but only one process is extracted; additional distinct processes are missing. Corrections needed: remove or properly structure plasmaPower; fix units for SS and carrier density; replace UV-Vis with SE; correct atomic ratios to reflect Table 1; remove or justify unreported parameters (pressure, GPC, cycles, dosing/flow rates, uniformity, conformality, refractive index, density); provide separate processes for base-layer, boost-layer, and bilayer IGZO supercycle depositions."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and contains many non-traceable or schema-violating entries. Key issues: (1) Missing processes: the article reports multiple distinct ALD processes that should be represented separately\u2014at minimum (a) base-layer IGZO (In0.52Ga0.29Zn0.19O, 13 nm), (b) boost-layer IGZO (In0.82Ga0.08Zn0.10O, 13 nm), and (c) bilayer IGZO (3 nm boost/10 nm base, total ~13 nm). In addition, dielectric ALD processes (PEALD HfO2 using TEMAHf/O2 plasma and thermal ALD Al2O3 using TMA/O3) are central to the device and not extracted. Only one process (largely corresponding to the base-layer) is provided. (2) Numerous values are fabricated/not traceable to the article: reactor manufacturer (\u201cSouth Korea\u201d), chamber pressure (10 mTorr), dosing times (1000 ms), flow rates (10/100 sccm), growth per cycle (0.1 \u00c5), number of cycles (150), nucleation period (5 cycles), uniformity (5%), conformality AR=10, refractive index (1.9), absorption coefficient (0.01), film density (5.2 g/dm3), and resistivity (0.0012 \u03a9\u00b7m) are not reported. (3) Schema and unit inconsistencies: plasmaPower is null (should be omitted if not used), thicknessControl structure is incorrect (filmThickness duplicated and placed under growthPerCycle), SS unit/value wrong (0.43 mV instead of 0.43 V/dec \u2192 430 mV), carrier density reported as 4.7e16 m\u22123 but article gives 4.7\u00d710^16 cm\u22123 (should be ~4.7\u00d710^22 m\u22123), reactor manufacturer mis-specified, elementalConcentration incomplete (only \u201c52%\u201d) and atomicRatio incorrect (\u201c1.0:2.8:5.4\u201d does not match 52:29:19). (4) Supercycle design counts (In2O3:10, Ga2O3:5, ZnO:2) are not given in the paper; the article only states composition control by subcycle numbers without explicit a:b:c values. (5) DeviceProperties focus only on the base-layer on SiO2/Si; the main results for the optimized bilayer with HfO2 and with Al2O3/HfO2 (e.g., \u03bcFE = 70.5 and 74.0 cm^2/V\u00b7s; SS = 0.17 and 0.13 V/dec; VTH \u2248 \u22120.25 and 0.20 V; ION/OFF ~ 2.6\u20133.2\u00d710^8) are not captured as separate processes/instances. Properties to add/review: add distinct process objects for base, boost, and bilayer IGZO depositions (and optionally HfO2 and Al2O3 ALD); correct film composition (In=52 at%, Ga=29 at%, Zn=19 at% for base; boost and bilayer per Table 1); correct device metrics for each device/gate stack; remove or justify any unreported parameters (pressure, dosing/flow/GPC, uniformity, conformality, density, refractive index, resistivity); fix schema placement and units for SS and carrier density; correct reactor manufacturer. Purge time (10 s), temperature (250 \u00b0C), precursors (DADI/TMGa/DEZ), co-reactant (O3), substrate, and roughness/crystallinity for base/boost/bilayer are available and should be used."
