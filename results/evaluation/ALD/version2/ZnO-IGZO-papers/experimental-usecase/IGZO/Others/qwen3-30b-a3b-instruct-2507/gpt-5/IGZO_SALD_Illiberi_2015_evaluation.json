        "rationale": "Major factual and schema issues throughout. Key problems: (1) Growth per cycle is wrong: set to 0.18 \u00c5 for IGZO, while the article reports ~0.18 nm/cycle for ZnO only (should be ~1.8 \u00c5 for ZnO; no numeric GPC given for IGZO). (2) Mixed and inconsistent thickness data: 1400 cycles/250 nm pertains to ZnO, yet the process filmThickness is 15 nm IGZO; both are included in one process, creating contradictions. (3) SupercycleDesign is populated (1:1:1) even though the article explicitly used coinjection (no supercycles). (4) PurgeTime and purging gas flows are provided, but S-ALD in this work does not use purge steps (\u201cpurge steps are no longer needed\u201d). (5) Arbitrary, unreported values are inserted: precursor/co-reactant/purging flow rates (sccm), refractive index, absorption coefficient, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, roughness, density, uniformity, conformality, subthreshold swing, on/off ratio, and \u201cHall measurements\u201d \u2014 none are reported in the article. Several values are also physically implausible (e.g., SS = 1.2 mV/dec; film density unit used implies 5.6 g/L). (6) ThresholdVoltage is set to \u221225 V, but the article cites \u221225 V as onset voltage; Vth is reported separately elsewhere and varies with composition. (7) Saturation is set to True without explicit support for IGZO; only ZnO is stated to grow in ALD mode. (8) ReactantSelection.coReactant lists only one entry for \u201cInGaZnO\u201d instead of per oxide component, inconsistent with the precursor list and article description (H2O used for all). Schema compliance issues: (a) processParameters.plasmaPower is null (violates object type; should be omitted if not PEALD). (b) thicknessControl does not satisfy the schema\u2019s required keys at the correct level (values and numberofCycles are nested under growthPerCycle instead of present where required). Overall, only a few items align (SALD method, 200 \u00b0C, atmospheric pressure, Ar carrier, H2O co-reactant, nucleation ~200 cycles, device structure, \u03bc_FE \u2248 3.5 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s), but the extraction is largely non-traceable or incorrect. Corrections needed: remove fabricated properties; fix GPC (and assign to ZnO or omit for IGZO); drop supercycleDesign; remove purge-related fields; align thickness to a single IGZO case; correct threshold vs onset; complete coReactant list per component; remove plasmaPower or set properly; restructure thicknessControl to meet schema."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "Largely incomplete/incorrect and weakly traceable to the article with multiple schema issues. Key problems: (1) Missing processes: the article reports separate ZnO and InZnO depositions (and corresponding TFTs) in addition to IGZO, but only one IGZO process is extracted. (2) Growth per cycle is misassigned and wrong: 0.18 is reported for ZnO as 0.18 nm/cycle, not IGZO; the JSON lists 0.18 \u00c5 for IGZO (10\u00d7 too small and wrong compound). (3) Film thickness/number of cycles inconsistent: 250 nm after 1400 cycles applies to ZnO; IGZO after 1400 cycles was ~60 nm in one case and the TFT film is 15 nm. The JSON contains two conflicting thickness values (250 nm in thicknessControl vs 15 nm at process level). (4) Reactant/co-reactant mapping incomplete: only one co-reactant entry for \u201cInGaZnO\u201d; the article states H2O for each metal oxide (ZnO, InOx, GaOx). (5) SALD purge steps and times are fabricated: SALD does not use time-based purges; purgeTime entries (120 ms) are not reported. (6) Flow rates (sccm) are fabricated; the article provides partial pressures (DEZ 1.96 mbar, TMIn up to 0.25 mbar, TEGa up to 0.37 mbar), not sccm. (7) SupercycleDesign 1:1:1 is inappropriate for this coinjection SALD process and not reported. (8) Many material and device properties are unreported or incorrect: refractive index, absorption, band gap, resistivity, carrier density, uniformity, conformality, roughness, film density, subthreshold swing, and on/off ratio are not provided in the article; \u201cHall measurements\u201d are not used (mobility is device-extracted); SS=1.2 mV and on/off=1e6 are unsupported. (9) Schema violations/inaccuracies: plasmaPower is null (type mismatch), growth-per-cycle unit/value mismatch, ambiguous elementalConcentration value without element label, and unsupported manufacturer claim. (10) Some elements correct (temperature 200 \u00b0C, Ar carrier gas, atmospheric pressure inference, nucleation period ~200 cycles, IGZO amorphous; device structure; \u03bc_FE \u2248 3.5 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s and onset ~ -25 V), but overall traceability and completeness are poor. Properties to add/review: add separate ZnO and InZnO processes; correct GPC (ZnO 0.18 nm/cycle) and remove/qualify IGZO GPC; fix film thickness and cycles consistently for IGZO; list H2O as co-reactant for ZnO/InOx/GaOx; replace purgeTime/flowRates with article-reported parameters (partial pressures, exposure times 20\u2013120 ms, rotation speeds 25\u2013150 rpm); remove supercycleDesign or mark N/A; include only device metrics reported (\u03bc_FE, V_th trends) and omit unreported properties; correct plasmaPower (omit for SALD)."
