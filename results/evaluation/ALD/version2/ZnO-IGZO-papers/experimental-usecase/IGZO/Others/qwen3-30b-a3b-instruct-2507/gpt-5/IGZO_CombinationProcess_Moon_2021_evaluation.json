        "rationale": "Major portions of the extraction are not traceable to the article, contain schema issues, or are internally inconsistent. Key problems include: (1) Unsupported/fabricated parameters: reactor manufacturer (Applied Materials), carrier/purging gas (Ar), reactor pressure (10 mTorr), delivery method, dosing/purge times, flow rates, optical properties (n, absorption, band gap), uniformity, conformality, roughness, film density, resistivity, carrier density, on/off ratio, threshold voltage \u2014 none are reported in the paper. (2) Schema violation: processParameters.plasmaPower is set to null, which is not an allowed type; omit this field if not using PEALD. (3) Internal inconsistencies: thicknessControl gives growthPerCycle = 0.1 \u00c5 and numberofCycles = 200 (implying ~2 nm), but filmThickness is 20 nm; deviceProperties.deviceStructure is given as \u201cbottom-gate top-contact\u201d while the article clearly uses BGBC (bottom-gate bottom-contact). (4) Misassignment of measurements: deviceProperties.fieldEffectMobility uses 9.9 cm^2/V\u00b7s, which is the saturation mobility (\u03bc_sat) of Dev. A, not \u03bc_FE as defined by the schema; materialProperties.electricalProperties.mobility is labeled \u201cHall measurements\u201d with 9.9 cm^2/V\u00b7s, but the article does not report Hall mobility for IGZO films (\u03bc_sat was extracted from TFT transfer curves). (5) Composition/process incoherence: filmComposition.atomicRatio '1:1:1.6' corresponds to composition B, while deviceProperties (\u03bc_sat = 9.9 cm^2/V\u00b7s, SS = 240 mV/dec) correspond to Dev. A; supercycleDesign and reactantSelection do not reflect the reported sub-cycle ratios (TEIn/In\u2013Ga/DEZn = 0:2:2, 2:2:2, 4:2:2) and bundle all precursors into one string instead of per-compound entries. (6) Partial correctness: temperature (150 \u00b0C), substrate (thermally grown SiO2/Si), oxidant (O3 for IGZO), and film thickness (20 nm) align with the article, and SS = 240 mV/dec matches Dev. A. To correct: remove or justify all unreported parameters, fix plasmaPower (omit), correct deviceStructure to BGBC, align mobility fields with the schema (use \u03bc_FE if available or clearly state \u03bc_sat under an allowed field), ensure composition/device data correspond to the same experiment, and represent the supercycle and precursors per compound with the reported 0:2:2 / 2:2:2 / 4:2:2 ratios."

    "completeness": {
        "rating": "1",
        "rationale": "The extraction is largely incomplete and contains many fabricated or schema-inconsistent values. Key issues: (1) Multiple processes in the article are not represented. At minimum, distinct IGZO ALD processes for compositions A (0:2:2, 150 \u00b0C), B (2:2:2, 150 \u00b0C), C (4:2:2, 150 \u00b0C), and D (2:2:2, 200 \u00b0C) should be separate processes; gate-stack oxidant variants (H2O, O3, O2-plasma for PL; H2O vs O3 for GI) that materially affect device outcomes are also not captured. (2) Supercycle design is incorrect: it lists a single \u201cInGaZnO\u201d subcycle instead of the reported TEIn/In\u2013Ga/DEZn subcycles with explicit counts (e.g., 0:2:2, 2:2:2, 4:2:2) and defined sequence. (3) Numerous parameters are untraceable to the article and appear invented: reactor manufacturer (Applied Materials), carrier/purge gas (Ar), chamber pressure (10 mTorr), dosing/purge times, flow rates, GPC (0.1 \u00c5/cycle), uniformity, conformality, roughness, density, optical properties, and film electrical properties (\u201cHall measurements\u201d), none of which are reported. (4) Internal inconsistency: 200 cycles at 0.1 \u00c5/cycle would yield ~2 nm, not the reported 20 nm film; yet film thickness is set to 20 nm. (5) Device-level fields are inaccurate: device structure is given as bottom-gate top-contact, but the article uses bottom-gate bottom-contact; threshold voltage and on/off ratio are not reported; \u201cfieldEffectMobility\u201d uses a value (9.9 cm2/V\u00b7s) corresponding to \u03bc_sat of Dev. A, not \u03bc_FE. (6) Schema issues: plasmaPower is set to null (type mismatch; should be omitted or provided with QUDT-compliant power units if PEALD is used); reactantSelection lumps \u201cTEIn/In-Ga/DEZn\u201d into one precursor string rather than per-compound entries; supercycleDesign lacks required, article-backed content. To improve completeness, add separate processes for A\u2013D with correct temperatures and supercycle counts/sequence, correct device structure, include only article-supported values (e.g., XPS-derived compositions and In/Ga/Zn ratios), and remove invented parameters (pressure, flows, dosing times, optical/roughness/density, etc.) unless verifiably reported."
