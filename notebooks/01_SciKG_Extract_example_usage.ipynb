    "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a surface-controlled thin film deposition technique that can enable ultimate control over the film thickness, uniformity on large-area substrates and conformality on 3D (nano)structures. Each ALD cycle consists at least two half-cycles (but can be more complex), containing a precursor dose step and a co-reactant exposure step, separated by purge or pump steps. Ideally the same amount of material is deposited in each cycle, due to the self-limiting nature of the reactions of the precursor and co-reactant with the surface groups on the substrate. By carrying out a certain number of ALD cycles, the targeted film thickness can be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extraction task, we are focusing on ZnO (Zinc Oxide) thin film deposition via ALD. A ZnO ALD (Zinc Oxide Atomic Layer Deposition) process deposits thin ZnO films through sequential, self-limiting surface reactions between a zinc precursor and an oxidant. The process typically consists of repeating ALD cycles, each containing a precursor pulse (e.g., diethylzinc (DEZ), Zn(acac)₂, or Zn(thd)₂), a purge step, an oxidant pulse (commonly H₂O, O₃, or O₂ plasma), followed by another purge. These reactions form a conformal zinc-oxygen layer per cycle with precise thickness control. The aim of a ZnO ALD process is to produce high-quality, uniform, conformal ZnO films with controlled thickness, crystallinity (amorphous or polycrystalline depending on temperature), and stoichiometry.\n",
