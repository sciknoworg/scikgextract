    "Welcome to the second tutorial of SciKGExtract! In this tutorial, we will expand upon the knowledge extraction process demonstrated in the first [tutorial](01_SciKGExtract_Knowledge_Extraction.ipynb) by incorporating normalization of the extracted entities, particularly chemical compounds, using external databases like [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This will enhance the quality and usability of the extracted knowledge for downstream applications.\n",

    "**Focus of this Tutorial:**\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on the following key aspects:\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Extraction**: We will utilize the SciKGExtract framework to extract structured knowledge from scientific texts, specifically focusing on the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of Zinc Oxide (ZnO) process.\n",
    "2. **Normalization**: SciKGExtract will be configured to normalize the extracted chemical entities using PubChem, ensuring that the extracted data is standardized and can be easily integrated with other datasets."

    "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a surface-controlled thin film deposition technique that can enable ultimate control over the film thickness, uniformity on large-area substrates and conformality on 3D (nano)structures. Each ALD cycle consists at least two half-cycles (but can be more complex), containing a precursor dose step and a co-reactant exposure step, separated by purge or pump steps. Ideally the same amount of material is deposited in each cycle, due to the self-limiting nature of the reactions of the precursor and co-reactant with the surface groups on the substrate. By carrying out a certain number of ALD cycles, the targeted film thickness can be obtained.\n",

    "In this extraction task, we are focusing on ZnO (Zinc Oxide) thin film deposition via ALD. A ZnO ALD (Zinc Oxide Atomic Layer Deposition) process deposits thin ZnO films through sequential, self-limiting surface reactions between a zinc precursor and an oxidant. The process typically consists of repeating ALD cycles, each containing a precursor pulse (e.g., diethylzinc (DEZ), Zn(acac)₂, or Zn(thd)₂), a purge step, an oxidant pulse (commonly H₂O, O₃, or O₂ plasma), followed by another purge. These reactions form a conformal zinc-oxygen layer per cycle with precise thickness control. The aim of a ZnO ALD process is to produce high-quality, uniform, conformal ZnO films with controlled thickness, crystallinity (amorphous or polycrystalline depending on temperature), and stoichiometry.\n",
